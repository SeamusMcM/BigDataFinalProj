Every challenge and obstacle in my life has helped me to become who I am today and provided me with the tests to display my resilience. I hope my life showed someone somewhere that if you endure the storm you will eventually get your chance to shine. I never give up and I have grown and learned so much and still am eager to learn more. I look forward to showing the world how much I have grown and getting out and helping my community. I have been blessed with the opportunity to be a recording artist and help others get their chance to be heard. To my fans I love you all and I want you all to know I am motivated and will not let my past decide my future. I chose to not focus my attention on my negativities but on my dreams. I will keep on hurdling and keep on hustling. My liabilties I turn to assets and even my inconsistincies make me the unique person I am. I am focused and I will be returning soon very soon so get ready. If I had to change anything in the last 10 years I would not change one thing. Sincerely Guwop!3Embed,0.056,0.722,0.222,0.994
