I had a show New Year's 2015, and I haven't came out with music in a while  Damn, finally, you gonna drop a new album  That show fuckin' sucked dick! That show was trash. What none of these kids knew was that I was halfway done with a brand new album *Tyler recording verse from DEATHCAMP* DEATH CAMP  I'm recording songs, directing these videos, doing these photoshoots, the release date is comin'  We look like Puffy and Mase on our jiggy shit, you feel me? You might also like And right before it releases, this bullshit happens Tyler here, and I'm makin' this video, just to prove the fact that I don't wanna get sued for sampling on my song DEATHCAMP that appeared on Cherry Bomb Now, I rarely sample. I usually play the instruments or get someone to play it if I can't. And the one time I sample for this album, it gets rejected, right before I have to turn the album in. I got Coachella, I got a tour comin' up, I don't really have time. But, fuck it, I gotta figure it out *Cole Alexander adding his vocals to DEATHCAMP* *Tyler recording clapping* *Cole Alexander playing a guitar riff* *Tyler playing and recording the tambourine* *Tyler recording his verse on DEATHCAMP* *Live performance of DEATHCAMP at Camp Flog Gnaw* BUFFALO  There's obviously an incredible intelligence and shit that I have no opinion on, but he's the dude to make that statement if he backs it up with intelligent thought. The problem is, America doesn't have the intelligent conversation that, they read a headline, but that's actually the problem. So half of me goes, fuck, this ain't my thing, but if this dude's gonna push a button that causes important dialogue, then fuckin' A dude, you know what I mean, 'cause I'm not proud of our whole shit, it's like, you know what I mean?  I usually just make shit 'cause it look cool, but people's brains misinterpret it whatever way they want it to, man... *Offstage filming of BUFFALO*  I should be that white face character I was in Tamale, because it's like no deeper underlying shit  You're just making art and then it's interpreted after.  *At a live performance*  I performed this shit in my bedroom, so this shit's personal when I'm just in my room dancin' alone. Play that shit, Travis? Me and my friends hang out at my house a lot, whether we're skateboarding or swimming or playin' a game or someone cooking some food that is really really trash I'm just really hungry, this shit is garbage *Live performance of PILOT*  I recorded Cherry Bomb in random houses because I like the windows and looking outside and stuff, and I think why the album has such a bright tone to it  Yo,   You got cum in your ear. *Laughs* Alright, back to my house, 'cause that's my, that's my comfort zone PILOT *Tyler records his verse on PILOT in his room*  I'm about to put this banana in my fuckin' ass!

When you're not afraid to be you, you're comfortable, when you're comfortable with yourself, you don't have that much hate in your heart, you're not that quick to judge, and when you're not that quick to judge, you're open to more things, and when you're open to more things, you're not ignorant, and when you're not ignorant, racism doesn't exist *Mocking Rocky* Yo, what up, I'm ASAP Rocky, you gettin' jiggy here with my mans, uh, I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem  This nigga Tyler though, almost killed me and Nico, on Washington Boulevard, the day before the carnival last year, just because this nigga was listening to some fuckass, turnt up Death Grips shit, bro  Yeah, I wrote RUN at like, nine in the morning. I wake up really early all the time, and I had logged in on Twitter just to, and I saw someone tweet 'bout to roll up'... Dude, that's all you do? And that's how that first line came, 'cause I thought to myself, 'all y'all niggas smokin' y'all brains out'. That song is really about a lot of the gang violence circle: All y'all niggas smoking y'all brains out In the car called life take the lame route Going nowhere fast but you think that you not Cause you never hesitate to take the thang out In the drop top, pop the trunk then pop pop At his drop top, took another lame out Oh you the big nigga?

I easily coulda hired a lady who sings opera or got one of the female singers who hits runs and coulda, I'm runnin' I'm runnin', just to emulate a string, but, I know Toro would do it perfect, and he does high pitch, like, he can do high, he can do low, he has such a middle that's really good too, so I just stacked all of 'em and... It came out perfect *Toro y Moi plays the chords to FUCKING YOUNG on his guitar* Those chords are gorgeous. I can't do without 'em. The day that I met Tony- Yo, yo yo yo yo! Back to RUN! I set up, like, all my recording stuff and my instruments in my living room downstairs You did it in your regular voice?  Runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin-  Look, it doesn't even have to be high-pitched 'cause, 'cause this is, remember the original, the original's, like, fast as fuck and pitched high. So, but I just couldn't record it at that speed, but that shit is- *plays instrumental* I couldn't record it that fast. And, it's going to be higher pitched, but right now, its- *plays instrumental*  Runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'  Follow the keyboard  Runni- might have to overdub it  What you mean?  It's such a weird jump. It's like, jumpin' octaves, it's kinda weird *re-records his line on RUN*  Uh, that last note right here, try to hold that  Hold it. Okay  Man, black people are gonna hate this song  I don't see y'all niggas bein' challenged to jump over a fucking car, jump over a trash can with both feet!  Where your knees at, nigga? Where your knees at? Oh, okay!  He clipped that shit!  Trash! Ay, go up, go up! Trunk now! Go up, trunk!  What, he's not gonna do it, did I not do it? Did I do it? I Already did it. I have nothing else to prove  The trunk! It's taller! Do the trunk, it's taller! Do the trunk, it's taller! See, look at him. There's always an excuse  What the fuck!  When I made, so, 2SEATER was made at the end of 2013, in my room, in like, twenty minutes, out of boredom again. I had just got my house, I was in my room, no furniture, no nothin'. And, this is cool, like, one minute and thirty second song, but I'm like, I wanna take it somewhere. I literally had wrote that string section, played it, and was like, okay, add all these instruments, I'mma get real players to play this, and then, hearing it come to life was so sick! HOLLYWOOD HILLS 5PM 2015  So, that's like the main part. I'mma use it throughout the song, but that's like the important part. Um 'cause (it's) eight bars, for the first four bars, you could get, like, riff it, get crazy, but like, when I start saying two seater and shit, like that part, you could get like soulful, repetitive, just so it doesn't get, uh, it doesn't get lost in jumble with my vocals *Aaron Shaw begins playing the sax*  That sounds amazing. Just do like, another pass where you just fuckin' let it all out, just do what this tells you *Aaron Shaw begins playing the sax*  Alright, alright, alright, you get it, you get it. So it's 8 PM, I'm about to record at Hans Zimmer studio, I'm a little nervous 'cause this is my first time with a actual string section, but, I know it's gonna be tight as fuck. Trust me, a lot of thought was put into this  Doubling things, and tripling-  These pads, they- So that should actually be A - Well, if we're doubling lots of-  But I'mma just pan this one-  Coming in with a swell is nice-  It might be easier to have-  Yeah, or, no, it should be, it should be on three. Dun dun dun dun dun- But dog, when you get that finished product? It's all worth it *____ begin playing strings*  I'm like, what is that? I think I could go higher!  Oh, shit! Why'd you do that?!  I'm starting over. I'm starting over! That was so  SAME NIGHT 30 MINS LATER WANDERING THE STUDIO  Hey! How are you!  I'm fine man, how are you? This is Hans Zimmer. If you're not familiar with his work, he scored a bunch of movies like Spiderman and Despicable Me, and... Oh yeah, Inception, and a bunch of other crazy shit, 'cause he's really talented and the list just goes on and on and on. And I got to see his secret little stuff in his secret little room Like, you can't make the same sound  No, exactly, and that's what I love, is it's totally unpredictable  Is this the one where you just plug in shit?  Yes  Oh my god  And there's a whole back wall. I got all this stuff   But more importantly, I got the nod of approval. So sick! High five! High five! Then you ain't shit, hoe Okay, okay, I'm fully not feeling this Black diamonds, yellow canary diamonds, white diamonds... BROWN STAINS *Tyler records his verse on Brown Stains*  I think ScHoolboy Q is a actual shermhead, and no-one can tell me any different. He's my fucking favorite ever, I love him so much. He's a shermhead I produced a song off his first album, I mean, we've been homies ever since, he's one of the only few rappers I fuck with, and I had made this beat, it sounded like, schizophrenic shermhead, whatever you wanna call it, automatically thought that the tone of voice ScHoolboy Q has would just sound ridiculous over it. I hit him up, he came at night, knocked his shit out in an hour. Bam Nigga that really makes me sad TYLER AND SCHOOLBOY Q RECORDING SESSION HOLLYWOOD CA 2015 *ScHoolboy Q records his verse on Brown Stains*  We gotta do it again. Let me   What are you doin'?

What else you get?   What else? Me and Q both got white Mclarens, but he got it after I dusted him in his weak ass Porsche of course  It was dope as fuck. Shout out to Tyler, we got the same car, it's tight  When I'm not making a song I can drive fast to or wild out on stage, I'm tryna figure out the right chords and melodies SINGERS *Tiffany Palmer, Onitsha Shaw and Samantha Nelson record their part for Find Your Wings*  I feel like rap has a timestamp on it. You could listen to My Cheri Amor by Stevie Wonder any time frame, ever. A five-year-old could listen to it. A eighty-year-old could listen to it. It's less boundaries with singing songs Keeping ALL the fuckups too My boy Austin, who's in a band called Slow Hollows, is really sick with guitar. He's playing on three songs on the album, and the things that I've learned from him, just over the years made me more comfortable, with who I am, and the things that I like, and just learning more stuff, and what keeps things fresh is just, new energy, and, not getting complacent and stuck. Working with these three girls was just amazing, they knew exactly what I wanted, and then in unison, they just sounded together, and they were open, and they- they made me feel comfortable KALI & TYLER RECORDING SESSION HOLLYWOOD TUESDAY 11 PM   Oh, my name's Kali Uchis, usually he already has something ready and he'll already have an idea, most of the time he writes everything, or he'll have a melody idea. Obviously he produces everything, so he really hones in on making sure everything is exactly how he wants it to be. 'Cause, when I met him, I had just started singing, I feel like I was still really learning about my voice. He definitely made me a lot more comfortable and experiment more with my range. I think what I admire most about Tyler, how dedicated he is, how much he really wants to make something meaningful that's gonna be lasting, rather than make something that, you know, will get to radio, or, will be, something that people listen to right now, and then maybe goes away later, I don't think he's ever really cared about trends, or, um, he just kind of follows what he wants to do, and, um, he works really hard *Unreleased song plays (possibly called Time Being)* *Clem records her part for OKAGA, CA*  OKAGA, CA is my favorite song on that album, and probably, to me personally, in my top five songs in my discography I remember hearing Clem a long time ago, and her voice stood out to me so much. It was so high pitched, and like, it almost had this kid-like vibe to it, to where it was just fun, and she was just like- it had no worries in it Pretend, you're Tido and Jermaine?, to youre Michael Jackson leads, so you you're own backup singers You know, she comes from this rock background, so to have her singing in a soul cadence, was really interesting to me. It's not many people who know how to hit those registers and riffs that I love. Me and Frank talk about it all the time, it's few people like Kim Burrell is one that we always bring up, Jasmine Sullivan, um, Alice Smith, I which- uh, she's on the OKAGA, CA song on the album, too *ALICE SINGS*  I'm Syd, I've known Tyler since I think 2008, so that would be 8 years. The biggest thing that I've learned from working with Tyler is to trust your ideas. I don't agree with all of his ideas, but when somebody, like, trusts themselves that much, makes you question yourself if you don't like it, and that's what I really got from him *SYD SINGS*  But working with Charlie Wilson, that was a whole 'nother story FUCKING YOUNG  I don't think I've ever been this stressed making a song. Charlie Wilson took what I had in my head and made it come to fruition so perfectly, that I started stressing out on the fact that I could never do anything that good *CHARLIE RECORDS*  What the fuck, I hate this. *Laughs* I fully, I fully can't take this He's a legend, and him taking cues from we was so weird *CHARLIE SINGS HIS PART FOR FUCKING YOUNG* FUCKING YOUNG VIDEO SHOOT  I'm so sorry!

Hey,  Ten years down the line, niggas gonna be like, SMUCKERS is legendary. That one's for the books, for sure. Yeah, finally just  working with those two dudes was just crazy! I remember playing it for Travis and Lionel, and we was like 'oh, shit', like, I really got these two niggas on a song Fuckin' fire! And I knew specifically, I wanted Wayne's tone of voice on there  I kinda- He texted me, just like, 'Man, I got this joint'. He's like a, perfectionist, so he's one of those guys that you know, you, he want, he know exactly what he want from you. Might fuck around and write your verse for you  So, I told him I wanted him over, and he was like, 'alright, cool'. I sent him my parts with his parts out, and then he just laid his shit down, and it was great by then. Went to 'Ye house, played it for him, he was like, 'cool'. Wayne sent me his shit the day after I played it, I went back the day after Wayne sent it and played it for 'Ye again, and he heard me and Wayne verse, and he was like *shakes his head* ripped his paper out of his notebook, balled it up, and started a new, and it was ideas on there, and he was like, 'Y'all niggas really 'bout to make me rap and go in, like, I ain't had niggas makin' me want to do that in so long'  First of all, Tyler changed the game. Maybe I probably had online, and I knew- I wouldn't say because people might think  it was too gross to put in a rap, or it didn't go with the whole vibeEmbed",0.133,0.718,0.149,0.9933

Start smiling more and start hanging around people that makes you feel good or make you want to be better. Stop associating with losers. If a nigga only hits you up to smoke or drink or turn up and have nothing else to offer to get you where ever you think about being when you are alone daydreaming, then get the fuck away from them. Time is going by so fast and before you know it, you're gonna be on your deathbed telling stories about how much you sucked and how you regret not living the life you wanted to live, loving the people you wanted to love, taking the chances you wanted to take. THERE ARE NO RULES. FUCK THE RULES. GO. FIND YOUR WINGS. I FOUND MY WINGS AND I'M STILL FLYING AND I WILL NEVER EVER LAND. Some of you have to find yourself. I knew who I was at like age 10.

Read the comments, the weak ass follower that will never make a difference ever because they fucking suck are gonna say some shit like ""easier said than done"" or ""you are a hypocrite"" or ""you changed"" or some stupid shit like that, because they are the weak fucks that I'm talking about and they can't cope with it, cause they are scared. DON'T BE SCARED I don't know why I'm typing this. I'm on a lake on vacation just drawing and listening to music (I've been playing CC The World for like 6 hours) and I just realized, ""Oh wow! I'm on a vacation for no reason, this is crazy. I've dreamed of this. How did I get this far? Oh yeah, by trusting myself and not following the path that my mom wanted me to go, and by surrounding myself with other people that wanted more out of life and trusted my wild ideas, and I put my art out there and people liked it and trusted me, and now I'm here. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want everyone to win. I want everyone to smile. I want everyone to be in a good mood and annoying and always jumping around like me cause I'm so fucking happy and grateful, but I realize niggas is scared. Or who knows, maybe I'm just a special one. I don't know anything. I'm in the woods and I really want to meet a moose in person. If I see one I'm gonna get a photo. Hahahahahaha.

171,171,"Tyler, The Creator",,FLOWER BOY: a conversation (Ft. Jerrod Carmichael),,"Tyler: Yeah it's—man I was like... 'Cause for Cherry Bomb I purposely was like, ""I don't wanna get personal at all. Like I'mma just make songs. This is all just, this is a song."" And in this one I was like, ""Alright, let me write down every feeling."" J: Oh, you started with emotions? T: Just—just, a lot of them was just asking questions. A lot of the songs just have questions, it's just like, ""How am I feeling today? Fuck, what if I go poor again? What if it doesn't work?"" And then that's how a lot of the songs just happened, just me kind of, just asking these quest—answering these questions, like, so... J: But it's speaking to, like, a mood you were in. Like—like you recorded this one, when did you... T: Um, mostly 2016—like I started to the end of 2015. A lot of spring, summer 2016, and then a lot of fall J: What were you listening to? Like— T: Um... J: Like watching and listening to? T: Pop music. I love—I was, like, listening to pop structure. Uh, kinda just what, like, Max Martin was doing and really getting into what, what Pharrell and Justin was doing— J: Yeah... T: And, um, just noticing, just hooks. I uh—hanging out with Travis, Taco. I went to the club with him and just seeing what people, how people reacted to certain— J: You never go to clubs! You might also likeT: I hate 'em. But when I would go I would just study, ""Oh, that, that bass drop,"" or,  ""Oh, that girl loves that part."" Just like, ""Okay, I want to have a song that has that feeling."" So I kind of was like, okay. I wanna see—challenge myself and try to make a few songs that's not like, ""Uh, rappity-rappy,"" or, super distorted, I was like... Last night, I went to—me and Lionel went to like a house party and they, they, all the songs they were playing—""Señiorita"" by Justin, ""Tell Me"" by Total, ""Frontin'"" by P—like, all these house partying songs. And ""See You Again"" came on, and it's full of black people, that for sure go to clubs, and they were in there, like, singing the lyrics and I was like, ""Oh shit, I've always wanted that."" J: To just have black people... dance... T: I, I did it. Yeah, yeah! I was so hyped, and I was—we were playing Jenga and I was being cool about it but inside I was like, ""Oh shit—"" J: You were going crazy— T: I finally have something that they could do that to J: It's funny because I guess I wouldn't have, uh, like thought about how much like pop is, you know, influenced in the album because, because of like the subject matter. Like, a lot of it is so heavy. That's why I was just wondering, were you in like a place of just like...? T: Well, uh, you gotta feed, you put the—some people, old people say you put the medicine in like the uh, the candy— J: The applesauce T: —Or the applesauce, whatever, so...  Like, with ""Mr. Lonely"" I was like, ""Aw dude, I want to write the saddest song I could possibly write and see people go crazy, and like dance to it,"" it's that. And at shows, that song is insane, and it's the saddest song I've ever wrote J: Yeah it really is—and you dance—I mean it's so hard, it's so hard, and like the greatest, like, bridge ever! What was that—what was that? I don't know if we—I mean I'm just gonna kind of jump into various songs—but like what, what was like, specifically that like... why that transition? Like, why did you think that was like, needed a transit—like was it, like it for emotional, like were you trying to create different moods? T: So, ""911"" and ""Mr. Lonely"" originally was, uh, a different song kind of together. It was this jazz take I had that was super triumphant and just sounded grand, and a lot of those lyrics was uh... was in that song and I just took 'em, and just placed them on ""911"" and then took the verse and placed it on ""Mr. Lonely"" and added some stuff. And, ""911""—the version that came out is the 25th version, it had... J: Wait, the 25th version? You did 25 versions of that song? T: It was 24. The first version was over an interlude song that Tony Toni Toné had. I looped it, sang over that, liked the hook that I put there, made 30 beats for it. It's—and the versions aren't just different type of lyrics, it's literally like... different beats, different melodies, all that J: A completely different vibe? T: Made that, took the beat from the fashion show I did, reworked that. Took the lyrics from the original ""Mr. Lonely"" and like, implementing it in that, and like, so the original ""Mr. Lonely"" it's like, uh... A five car garage Full tank of gas A call for every day of the week and it go really fast But it means nothing, nothing, nothing Without you, shotgun  J: Yeah, yeah... T: Right yeah. That's in the last version of ""911""... Five car garage Full tank of the gas But that don't mean nothing, nothing Nothing, nothing So you kept that based on the previous, you just- Tyler: Exactly, so I took it from this jazz song, and I was like, ""nah, I want them to groove to this shit,"" so I put it on that Jerrod: I actually always wondered why that bit repeat- Tyler: Well yeah it just 'cause it was from it was it was from the bass of the other one but when I put it there and drop the beat people I was like ""oh people are gonna love saying this."" And if you see that shows I don't even say it I just put the mic and the whole -ten thousand people: "" nothing, nothing, nothing."" And I'm like I figured it out and I- Jerrod: You figured out—that, that feeling that you want, the feeling of just everybody really connecting with it but wait- specifically the bridge on that- what was like- Tyler: Oh oh what the ""chirp chirp"" part? Jerrod: I say bird- but like, which is the most one of the most addictive things- Tyler: I ain't made that, I remember I made that and it was just the beat and I remember stopping like ""I made the bridge that I've always wanted to make. Lonny came by-or Frank however people know him-  and he came by and I played it for him he's like you let me go in there Just try something he just started making phone noises and it worked out so perfectly and we was like ""alright"" and- Jerrod: was it longer? Tyler: no that part I'm just giving niggas eight bars of these chords just so they could want it so they could replay it and left it at that Jerrod: How did you balance out and this is kind of for the whole album your love of chords with-you always talk about and you always say ""niggas don't want chords"" and that's all you're obsessed with. It's just everything is specific and just- Tyler: I just Want chords and melodies Jerrod: Yeah. and was it like a battle- cause the whole album has chords Tyler: Yeah, I fucked up-well I didn't fuck up but Cherry Bomb was an album full of bridges and shit going everywhere, so I was like, let me for this album specifically add all the chords I like but  do it in a way that they can digest. So Mr. Lonely has some of the prettiest chords on the album, but I kinda hid it behind the hard drums and the fast paced rap, but if you really listen it's really fucking pretty- Other: Rolling!  Tyler: Thank you. And I was like I'm definitely gonna-just try to hide it in those and stuff. And 911 even the uh, ""call me some time."" I was listening to Gap Band and I was like damn, these are simple chords and I love the melody let me try to implement it in this and make it as simple as possible but it still gives me that feeling. So the part where I was like ""fuck it I'mma go crazy, I right before Steve Lacy's part when it goes back to the hook and it's like: ""dun, dun, dun ,dun ,dun"" and I was like I'mma go on my Jill Scott shit and that's my favorite part of that song, just cause it just- Jerrod: It has all the chords that you love Tyler: Exactly Jerrod: Umm, do you wanna... Tyler: You could cut it now  Jerrod: ""I can't even lie..."" Where does the.. Tyler: I can just imagine a nigga in a wife-beater on Valentines Day like in the hood and like- Jerrod: Is he talking to his friends or in the mirror- Tyler: I don't know who he's talking to but it's a quick shot like ""I can't even lie I've been lonely as fuck nigga,"" just being honest with his homies or something, and I was like man that would be really funny to chant. But it's the perfect set up for when that song comes on. It set's you up for like what's 'bout to happen. It's honest but it's right here and they go crazy when they- Jerrod: It's like so sad it's hilarious. It's like there a group of niggas chanting- Tyler: And that's Rocky. That's Rocky yelling that. That's Q, I think that's Wyatt, that's Lionel, that's Jasper- Other: Ah, don't talk, the camera.. Jerrod: Alright  Jerrod: Foreword is ah- ok, first of all, that tempo is very weird. It's like a really weird tempo that you found, was it kind of just like a challenge? Tyler: Well so, that's a loop from this band called Can. I've always been into krautrock, its like- it was a sound that was very European, like Eastern Europe, and you got like Can, The Silver Apples, even Soft Machine, which was this really proud jazz band that took influence around that time. And it's kind of what Portis Head listens to for influence, and it's something I've always liked because it's just so weird and just- this weird drum patterns and these haunting bass lines, and that's a song that they had and everytime I played it I would just rap over it. And I was like fuck it I'mma loop it, add these- Jerrod: Is it hard to rap over, just the- Tyler: Not actually, It's actually just the ""one ,two, three, four"" but the pockets that they would use makes its sound like this weird push and pull back thing Jerrod: Yeah it feels like your on something, you know what I mean? Just kinda pulls. Yeah and its like- that pocket is such- the pace of it, when you're rapping over it is you do a little bit faster than I would expect. Like a little bit more- why, why that song first? Why that mood though first? Where you trying to set a-? Tyler: I remember making it like ""this need to be the first song."" Just go in, just so you can see where I'm at in my head, and I remember writing that verse fully like.... ""how much shit can I buy, till it gets boring"" like ""how many jumps can I do on a bike until I'm over it and on to the next thing."" And every answer that I had went to the next question, like ""was it ever enough."" Jerrod: it almost sounded it was so existential and contemplative and it almost sounded suicidal, especially the ""if I'm going and don't come back""- do you know what I mean? It was so dark its- Tyler: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was the end question like ""damn, what if I died? What happen? And that's kinda what it was and just to set the tone of like that's where I'm at. And it's not depressed-I'm not depressed at all. A lot of people mix up depression with self awareness. Someone was like ""dude this album is depressing"" and I was nah, I never said I was depressed. I'm lonely, but I'm having the most fun of my goddamn life. But that song kinda sets that tone Jerrod: Ok, I mean if you're considering death, but it's not from a depressed, sad state, is it from a state of like ""alright I've got something to prove"" cause it almost seems like you had a thing to prove on this album. I don't know to yourself, or like- Tyler: Well, a lot of people do stuff for the conversation of when they're dead. Like hopefully, when I die people can say ""oh he-this, this and this,"" I leave a good discography behind, but- Jerrod: Yeah, I like to start with every project, I like to start from death and work backwards Tyler: Exactly Jerrod: It's just like, we're all gonna die someday Tyler: I  just knew that if this album wasn't good I would be fucked. That's how I felt. And some people would disagree, but I'm like, man I'm nothing right now Jerrod: You felt like that coming off of Cherry Bomb? Tyler: Yeah yeah yeah, cause everyone hated it, except for like, real music lovers who care about drums- like I opened a rap album with a rock song. Most niggas was like ""uh."" And then ""Buffalo"" comes and you can barely hear what I'm saying, and then ""Pilot"" comes on and it's this 80's music and they're out cause they want rap. Then ""Run"" comes, dun, dun,  and then ""Find Your Wings"" comes and they're like ""this is chill,"" and then Cherry Bomb comes and just punches them-so they're out and a lot of people didn't know how to take it so- But ""Find Your Wings"" and stuff felt so- I don't even know if I mean lyrically, I mean sonically, going back to your love of chords and stuff like that and you would on Cherry Bomb"" it seems like you would have chords and distort it, like it was you were always running from it and covering it up, so that-saying it's your most personal album, removed from the subject matter, it feels that way, like sonically Tyler: Yeah, I fully get that yeah. never thought that Jerrod: It just feels like a real- Okay so the sadness of Foreword that goes into almost the like- I'm going to say almost this cockiness of ""Where This Flower Blooms."" Do you feel like you were accepting yourself?  Tyler: So its a lot of things-and I don't wanna take credit-that I was doing that people were like, what is he doing, and then two years later it's what everyone's doing, whether it's the way videos are done or these stupid pop-up things or whatever, and I'm not taking credit, but I was doing that and no-one ever puts me on these lists or respects me in the sense that I wanted. So I was just, and that's why that line is like: ""Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that just may be my ego but don't be too cool"" because I may freeze, and I'm stuck in this egotistical mindset and I never move forward, and that's how niggas freeze to death, but that ""ice, shit weighs a ton, water your garden, my nigga and stunt."" I got a flower chain made, with all these different things, and that's what I was talking about, but I was like, fuck these niggas, keep doing my shit, uh, and ""tell these black kids they can be who they are""- Jerrod: That's one of my favorite lyrics, is just ""tell these black kids they can be who they are"" Tyler: Dude, right! Jerrod: Like it's one of my favorite- you had another lyric like that on Cherry Bomb that was just like, ""the world is yours little nigga"" like ""my little nigga, the world is yours."" Like I love that- like it's a similar thing like, tell these black kids they can be who they are. Where you saying that to you or the people you see...? Tyler: I was saying that to me to but it uh, it's no-one saying that to kids that look like me, or anyone that looks like me. We had this conversation just wanting to snowboard when I was 12, but someone was like ""oh, that's white people shit. Black people don't do that."" No, you don't do that, don't put a damper on me and tell me what I can a can't be just because of the way everyone else was that's my same color. And I just feel like I just wanted to tell them like ""be you""- J: Who you are is such the alternative of the expectations are placed on like a young black guy growing up. Like you're influenced by kind of everything, kinda all cultures, so do you think you accepted that by yourself through your music T: I knew who I was at like 12 J: I think you rapped maybe 28% on the album. It's like so- T: My goal for this album was to shut the fuck up, and let the all feature be the leader. ""Yes, Rex, here sing for two minutes before I come in with an 8 bar on 'Boredom' and then I'll have another 8 bar but I wanna shut up and just let the string section be 2 minutes at the end."" J: ""Boredom"" I think-I found out about it this morning- ""Boredom"" right now, to me, is like your ""Billy Jean.""  T: Really? J: It really is kind of a- seeing people connect with that song... That song influenced... I think I called you and said if I don't know this song is creating an emotion for me or if it's like the soundtrack to something I already feel. Like that's how powerful I think it is T: Well, I wrote that, literally, it was a 5 pm on a Saturday, laying on my back, looking so bored. It was nothing to do, no-one was hitting me back, Jasper was in the other room, bored out of his mind but I didn't see him the whole day, my room was warm as hell because I like the heater on, and there was nothing to eat but dry cereal and I'm sitting thinking ""what the fuck am I going to do?"" I literally wrote that verse in 10 seconds, cause again, it was these questions and these legit feelings of boredom that I was having. And it was weird to me 'cause it's like... I'm in a tax bracket where I can go do whatever. I have all these cars, I can go drive--but I have nowhere to go and I'm just bored. And it was just confusing to me 'cause it's like- J: You don't understand how you could possibly-- T: How the hell I could be bored when its... but there was nothing to do at the moment. So I was like, fuck it, I'm gonna write a song about it J: Jasper has to listen to that song and be like ""fuck you nigga I was right there"" T: I wrote the song over the chords of ""God Bless the Child"" by Stevie Wonder. I figured out the chords, looped it, and had it just playing for hours in my room. And I wrote the verse, which was like a 40 bar verse originally, but I cut it in half 'cause I was like the hook needs to come back. So, at the end of the first verse, it's like ""I'm... bored."" I did that right when we was editing 'cause it went to the end of the verse, it was like, originally, ""I'm bored and getting desperate. Phone is not--"" It went straight to a different verse and it was a different pocket but I cut it, because I was like I need to put the hook back in here, 'cause I don't wanna hear myself J: Yeah, 'cause it's a weird chunk, just, ""I'm... bored. Find some time!"" T: Uh huh. So I added that right when we was editing, finishing, I was like, ""No no no, fuck that, put the hook. Imma change the second verse a little bit and like, so the pocket is easier to rap so everyone could say it."" 'Cause it was too rapitty, you know, and I was like, nobody wanna hear this deep ass voice rap for that long; let me shut the fuck up and do a hook, so all the white girls at Coachella can sing this shit  T: And, I'm not lying, doing festivals, you realize white people love singing along to shit  T: That's why, the fucking, Boredom is two minutes of just this like... Director: Roll up!  J: When you perform this album live, you start on Where This Flower Blooms, usually. Is it a longer intro? T: Yeah yeah yeah, so... I wanted this album to sound like a Disney score. Just like, very magical. My perfect little indie movie, and, fucking... J: Sound like the album cover looks T: Yeah, sound like the album cover looks like. But, it turned into, you know, what it turned into. Where This Flower Blooms had this very beautiful longer intro, I shortened it a bit, but, it sound like the beginning of a movie J: It's sweeping and... T: Yeah, I start the shows with that because it's like bringing them into my world and then it drops and gets crazy but... yeah J: How long did you-- why did you trim it and not just go- T: I just wanted to cut the fucking fat. I wanted this album to be no longer that 45 minutes. And I think we hit 45:36 or 46 minutes and I was like, okay, cool. I just want it to be short and get to the point and yeah J: You were talking about questions and how every song is sparked by a... thing.  My favourite sequence of this-- of these songs, but... uh, Pothole is inspired by something your mom said to you. Is that like...  T: A long time ago she was like, ""yo, some people just aren't really as loyal or close to you as you think."" And I'm always like, ""shut the fuck up, like, what the fuck are you talking about?"" Sometimes moms know best and I had to find out on my own, like, oh wow, she wasn't wrong about that person. And I kind of wrote that verse like: ""My mom told me, blah blah blah."" And, uh... J: So you singing that more? You started singing that more T: Yeah, and even like, I did it in the car like, I drove back to the points where she told me specifically. Like, when you make three lefts it makes it right. So like, I triple left tryna double back. And the streets are filled with clues that she told me J: And that's great, that some of your best-- T: But, how I ain't notice that. And I see some familiars, I see some people I knew, stuck in the cul-de-sac. I pull up, get out, ""what up"", I wanna help you. But what you want for some people they don't want for themselves. So, do I stay here and try to figure it out, or do I go, and traffic is picking up? And if I don't leave now and get on my path and do what I need to do, Imma be stuck, and  (21:36)1Embed",0.11,0.688,0.203,0.9999

I Never Been To Camp And In My Head, I Created A Place That I Figured Would Never Exist, But That Changed. Just Fliping The First Letters Of Wolf Gang Turned Into Its Own Separate Thing. Seeing All Different Races From Skinny To Fat To Everything All In One Place With Something In Common Was Mind Blowing. The Zipper Is My Favorite Ride In The World. Not That You Care, But That Fact That I Figured Out How To Get That Thing And Ride It For As Many Times As I Want Without Waiting In Line IS Fucking Amazing I Have An Amazing Team With Me. No Matter How Crazy And Offensive Or Weird My Ideas Were, They Put Their Trust In Me And Allowed Me To Move Forward.Like Dude, We Threw A Fucking Carnival In The Middle Of Los Angeles With 10k Plus People. We Didn't Have Any Crazy Sponsors And I Didn't Have To Suck Up to Anyone Or Any Of That Shit, WE Did It. And The Skatepark? Did You See That Skatepark? I Was Up Till 2 Am Painting That Bitch! Growing Up In Hawthorne At The Dirty ( skatepark) And Seeing My Old Friends From There Getting Clips Was Prolly The Craziest Shit Ive Seen. How Far Ive Came With Every Little Idea that I Believed In No Matter Who Did Or Didn't. Walking Around Seeing Kids In EXACT Things That I Wear Is Mind Blowing. Something That I Just Naturally Like And Put On, Its Some Kid Out There That Studies Every Article Of Clothing That Was Put On And Emulates That. Thats Crazy To Me. I Used To Do That With P, So Know That Someone IS Looking At Me The Way I Look At Him Is Really Amazing To Me I Didn't Think I Would Change So Many Lives. Someone Retweeted An Old Tweet Of Mine From Feb 2012 Yesterday And It Read ’ I Had A Dream That Kanye Invited Me To Perform LATE With Him. I Wish’. Kanye Came To The Carnival And I Performed Late With Him. My Favorite Song By Kanye, AN Album Cut He NEVER Does, Was Performed Not Only With But During My Set And My Carnival! No Matter if You Hate Me Think Im Stupid Untalented Annoying Or Whatever, I FUCKING WIN AND YOU CAN SUCK MY WHOLE SHIT. We Did This, OF Did This, Coming From Actually Jack Shit And Turned That Jack Shit In Something. I’m Just Blabbing Now. I Just Want Who Ever Reading This To Know That Anything Is Possible, No Matter How Crazy It May Seem, Anything IS Possible You Just Have To Figure It Out. Get Your Self Esteem Up And Like Yourself, Then Like Your Ideas. We Live In A World Where People Dont Even Like Their Own Ideas, That Why You Have People Copying One Thing Thats Working So Much, Then Everything Gets Over Saturated With The Same Shit, And That Goes With Fashion, Music And All That. If People Actually Loved Themselves And Believed In Themselves More You Know How Many More Crazy Things Would Be Created? There Is No Fucking Limit To Anything! ( Except Elevators) Its A World Of People Who Dont Give A Fuck About The Mall Or The Radio Or None Of That Shit, Who Dont Care About Race Or If Someone Is Gay Or What Not. Thats What I Was Trying To Say On That Arsenio Interview. I Prolly Came Of As An Idiot Tho. Im Really Passionate About Everything I Do. From Music To Clothing To Videos. I Love Make Videos So Much. I Just Want Some Millionaire To Throw Me Money To Be Creative And Get Shots. I Remember Kids In School Always Thought I Was Weird, Not Just Cause How I Dressed Or The Music I Liked Or That Fact I Was Just Different Overall( in comparison to them), But Because I Was So Open With Future Goals. I Would Always Say The Grammies Im Gonna Get, And The Number 1 Movie Im Going To Write And Direct, And Just Random Shit Im Gonna Do. Now Those Same Dude Who Shut Me Down Are Paying Shitty College Debt Doing Something They Hate, Because They Didn't Go Full Throttle On Their Own Dreams And Quickly Shitted On Mines. And Im Not Knocking Anyone In College, Please Get Your Education, Im Just Saying, Do What You Love And Be Happy, Dont Live For Anyone Else. I Dont Like The Color Black. I Dont Know What That Has To Do With Anything But I Like Colors, Bright Colors, Like Flowers. It Brings A Great Energy Ok Im Just Talking Again. Its Prolly A lot Of Typos In This But Im Just Going Off Of What Ever Is Coming To My Head. This Photo Of Na-Kel Smith Skating In Front Of The GOLF Mural At The Skatepark Means So Much To Me.

I was optimistic, always daydreaming and setting goals so I felt you were directly speaking to me. I remember clancy telling me how Jimmy Iovine thought this album was a “complete fucking failure it didnt work”. But see, it did, just not on the kids he was looking at. The ones who just existed; used the popular slang; listened to what was thrown at them; dressed in clothing that was trending at the time. Not saying that's bad but of course this wouldn't work on them. But it worked on me and I created Odd Future that same summer. I was actually naive enough to believe you and thought I could do all these amazing things if I really tried. Where I grew up, niggas get stuck and never make it out. Jail, dead, shit jobs, not really growing. It seems like at a certain age, ideas; original thoughts are no longer a thing; I didnt fall into that cycle. I’m now a young entrepreneur all because I believed you when you said I could be. You were the first person I contacted when I pulled off that McLaren dealership! This is getting long so uhhh, hbd IMM. I never had brothers, uncles or my father around so thank you for being the male figure I gravitated to.

Information contained in this affidavit was obtained from Officer Perez #6676 and Officer O'Farrell #5948 and contained in the Austin Police offense report 14-0721336 Officer Perez and Officer O'Farrell both stated to Det Lyons that they were assigned to a Unified Command Public Assembly Code Enforcement (PACE) Team for escort during SXSW events taking place in Downtown Austin, TX. The officers stated they were assigned to assist the PACE team with enforcing city code on occupants inside establishments for public safety reasons in the entertainment district Officers stated to Det Lyons that the Pace team received a call for service at the Scoot Inn located at 1308 E 4th St due to a possible overcrowding. Officer Perez and O'Farrell stated to Det Lyons that they arrived on the scene with the Pace team and observed a large crowd. Officers stated the establishment was at capacity with 999 people inside. Officers stated to Det Lyons that the employees who were assigned to work the door for the Scoot Inn were allowing 1 person inside as 1 person exited the establishment. At this time, Officer Perez and O'Farrell walked inside of the establishment to check the area and observed the performer ""TYLER THE CREATOR"" onstage. The officers stated to Det Lyons that at that moment ""TYLER THE CREATOR"" yelled out to the large crowd of people waiting in line outside the building ""ALL YALL OUTSIDE THE GATES YALL PUSH THROUGH.""

The cockroach climbs to his other hand, and Tyler stares at it intently as he raps. It crawls over his hand, and then onto his other hand again. Tyler brings his hand up and looks down on the cockroach, and we see the word ""Kill"" written in sharpie on the back of his hand. We also see an upside-down cross drawn on his middle knuckle. The cockroach climbs to the edge of his hand and it crawls onto his other hand, and Tyler stares at the camera. Tyler brings the hand with the cockroach down, out of the view of the camera. He brings it back up in between his fingers and puts it in his mouth. He chews, and the camera begins panning out, bringing Tyler in and out of focus. He makes a face of disgust, and stands up from the stool, heaving. Tyler becomes a silhouette, and he throws up onto the floor. It takes a while, and then he wipes his mouth and spits onto the floor. He sits up on the stool and he comes back into focus. He begins rapping again, pausing to spit on the ground again. The camera slowly pans in until the upper half of his body is showing. He begins unbuttoning his shirt. He unbuttons his shirt all the way and then his gestures become very animated. He grabs his face in rage, showing that he is wearing a chain. He then takes his shirt off  all the way. The camera zooms in to Tyler's face, with the image becoming extremely blurry and then in sharp focus. We see that Tyler's eyes are dark black, and then we see only Tyler's teeth, then his eyes again. Tyler gives the camera the middle finger. Tyler begins to move around a lot, agitated, grabbing his chain. He becomes completely out of view at one point, then when he comes back into view, his nose begins to bleed. He wipes the blood off his top lip. The camera zooms out, and a noose falls from the ceiling. Tyler grabs the noose and wraps it around his neck. He stands on the stool, and we only see his feet. The stool falls over, and the legs begin thrashing, as Tyler hangs from the noose (out of view). His legs twitch as his legs swing back and forth. The camera moves to see the stool on the ground and Tyler's feet dangling. The feet finally stop twitching, and they just sway around in a circle. The camera shifts in and out of focus. (Tyler is dead).3Embed",0.038,0.902,0.06,0.8887
