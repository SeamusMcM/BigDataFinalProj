6,Drake,N/A,2016 MTV VMAs Vanguard Award Intro for Rihanna,NA,"Today the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the one and only, Rihanna. Captivating from day one, the iconic being that is Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them, that's often the peak, but for her, that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since. When it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances, they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style, she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself, which is when it gets a little awkward. What's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats, awards and accomplishments. What's most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself. This woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all, we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one. She's someone, she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old. She's one of my... she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I've looked up to her even though she's younger than me. She's a living, breathing legend in our industry. Ladies and gentlemen, the recipient of the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award for 2016: Rihanna.3Embed"

I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days.

It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy See that was a segue, I believe the matter Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in And some places is breezy, and some it start snowin' And if you planning family vacations you better know when But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!

136,Drake,N/A,Drake & DJ Semtex Interview,NA,"When we hooked up years ago, you were supposed to come on the show, it didn’t happen but we connected the day after and did a legendary interview in Hyde Park. I said it felt like you’re gonna make history  It’s been a while, that’s kinda how we ended up here. When I got here , I was just like in my room, just tryna find my lineage of coming to London and just trying to figure out where it all started. And I just watched that Hyde Park interview and I’m watching this kid, it’s me but to me it’s just a kid that’s just trying to talk, trying to answer questions in the best way possible. Just the fact that we were just walking around, just me, you, a microphone and a camera. I was like “man I should hit Semtex up, man we should talk again”. I feel like that was a good conversation, we covered a wide spectrum of things and I think it’s been a long time since somebody’s been able to sit down and do that with me, and that’s how we’re here  How’s it feel to go from doing mixtapes, So Far Gone was the mixtape that really broke, before that Lil Wayne mentioned you in an interview with me, and I started following you and it’s just grown. From there you’ve been non-stop, its crazy…  Yeah that was an amazing time for all of us… still doing it with the same people. It was just… our landmark for that project is 15 Fort York, which was “40” and Oliver’s apartment and we really started that project there. Then it moved to the Beverly Hills Hotel in LA, when we were first just getting around Wayne, I know Wayne mentioned me in the interview, but the real turning point for me was when Wayne went on stage at the MTV awards and rapped one of the verses from ‘Money To Blow’. Instead of doing his own verse he just impromptu rapped one of my verses. And at that time, people are like, people from back home who really didn’t….. I mean it was just a tough thing to believe like, “I know he says he’s over there but is he gonna come home with a Lil Wayne record, is this gonna really happen” at that time people were like “ok he just rapped Drakes song, if he gets a Wayne record this is outta here” That was when I was able to come back off those trips with Ransom. I went back home with Ransom, which was the first time I had ever got a Lil Wayne verse. From there I had a bunch of songs that I had recorded at the studio called Hot Beats and Wayne just got on all of them like ‘Stunt Hard’ and ‘Forever’ was one of them, early early. Then we started crafting that first project and using the input of two people who again I still work with to this day and my music wouldn’t be what it is without them, that’s Oliver and ‘40’ – you know it’s funny cos we’re sitting here talking and they’re back in Toronto executive producing ‘More Life’. Oliver’s executive producing it and ‘40’ is obviously always involved, but kinda just a full circle moment for us, cos Oliver had so much input on ‘So Far Gone’ so I was like “man it would be nice to do something with me and you again”, so I gave him that task and he’s at home piecing it together. So yes it was a great start and from there it just became a wild journey that I guess we’ll talk about  A lot to talk about – ‘More Talk’… Since we’re right at the beginning, I was in Amsterdam with Lil Wayne….and he tells me – Yo he’s been writing on ‘Detox’ that was like the mythical album, you gotta be about your business to be involved in that, or to be in the studio. How did you end up from doing a tv show to working with Dr Dre, writing for him on Detox? It’s taking it back…  Its taking it back, I’m not usually that good with the ‘taking it back moments’ but I actually remember this one vividly. But yeah, I was on the show and while I was on the show, I started getting less and less character time, because of the fact that everybody was taking a notice to just the fact that I was more focused on music. And at the time I actually had a studio that was right by the film studio for Degrassi, so I ended up working out a deal with the after hours staff where I would leave work, go home get my stuff – Degrassi was all the way in the east end, which is Scarborough that’s like an area of our city. I’d go home all the way back to the city, get my stuff, come back to the studio, I would record and around 4/5am I would sneak back into Degrassi, they’d let me in and I would go to sleep in my dressing room. Eventually they found out what I was doing and they got really upset. During that time I was crafting all these songs, and I had a song that Omen produced – it was me and Mickey Factz and somebody else was on it I think. So Dre had heard the song and he had hit me like, “man I need proof that you wrote this” (laughs), so I had to fax him the lyrics of the song, I had to send him a fax message, from my moms fax machine in her bedroom I sent him a fax You know at that time, Detox was going on, it was more like he had just a camp of people, I guess churning out ideas and just trying to spark something. I was flown out to record at Record One, which is a legendary studio. Yeah I was in there for a while, I did a lot of work, me and ‘40’, always brought ‘40’ with me, that was like a stipulation in my career, I wouldn’t move without ‘40’, so brought ’40’. Got to meet a lot of great people, obviously got to work with Dre, and it kinda all came to an end, when I.. Dre brought me into his office and said “Man you’re doing really good work” and he gave me a $10,000 cheque, and it was the most money I’d ever had in my life and at the time I was in a relationship. So I got the money and I called my girl, and I flew my girl down to L.A and was like “we can get a hotel this is crazy”, it was just a joyous moment for me. And I had missed studio or I had done something wrong, I had let my mind deviate from work and I had missed something, and next thing I know I was sent home and that was kind of it. It was a huge life lesson for me and I still have that… Actually when Dre came out at the Forum, I brought him the $10,000 cheque cos I had saved the actual hard copy of it, even though I got the money for it, they let me keep a copy of the cheque So yeah that was kinda my dealings with that very early on, and I had heard rumblings, like oh all these people are here and I had met Snoop, and I kinda wrote this song, that ‘40’ still has somewhere for Dre and Snoop. We listened to it not to long, couple years ago, its kinda hard. But yeah it was a great experience, a great learning experience for me and ‘40’, it brought us closer and it just taught us about how this shit really works and I think that set us on our own path  So lets fast forward to 2015/2016, VIEWS one of the most successful albums, the tour you did in America was the most successful tours. How do you feel about what you achieved with VIEWS and the reaction? It’s a very pivotal point for you, going from writing for Dre and being on a TV show all the way up to … You might also like Yeah I mean, it was one of those moments in my career, where the album started to build and build and build and you know when anticipation starts to build, it can either result in massive failure or massive success. Obviously somebody’s watching over us and it resulted in massive success for us and it was also just an opportunity for me to really take a lot of risks that I felt I was ready to take at that moment. And yeah, I mean I was obviously very proud of it from the title to the cover, to just the styles of music that I felt we introduced almost as a package. It kinda started with ‘Work’ because ‘Work’ came out before my album, and then progressed into ‘One Dance’, ‘Controlla’, ‘Too Good’. But just the style of music that was making me happy at the time, because to be completely honest with you I was having trouble figuring myself out in rap at that time I was a very defensive individual just coming off the situations that I’d come off of. I was having trouble trying to make rap music where I was able to peel back the layers and every time I’d make a song – ’40’ is always really bluntly honest with me and was like “Man you really sound like aggressive and defensive” – and I was just trying to figure out why and I realised it was just a reaction to my previous situation that had kinda happened before that So there was a time where I actually thought about taking the rap off of VIEWS and just making it an album full of music that made me happy with melody. But obviously I know why I’m here, I know who my core fanbase is, and so towards the end of the album, I tried to execute it as best as I could, on the rap end. You know I still listen to the bars and I know exactly where I was at and they are great to me, and they are time markers to me, but yeah, I guess we’ll get into ‘More Life’ after and how that situation progressed. But yeah VIEWS for us was, it was surreal, the numbers and all the things we were able to achieve, it was an incredible time for us. And of course in true OVO fashion we didn’t celebrate it all, we just kinda went on to working on the next thing. That was kinda it, it was just another album to us, it wasn’t my biggest album by any means, it wasn’t the one to me, it was just another chapter in the story but I’m very grateful for the people who enjoyed it and supported it. Whether people want to admit or not, the influence that it’s had on music, I feel is very evident, whether people don’t wanna say it  Did you know what you were doing when you made ‘One Dance’, Kyla’s on there, Wizkid is on there, it’s a truly global records, because I think very few people have done what you’ve done with mixing everything with the US, the UK and African sounds. Did you know how big it was going to be, it was the song of the year  It really all started with the Kyla record, it was just a song that I had played, we Dj at our own parties just because …  How did you discover it though, that’s like a UK underground Funky Sound…  I mean I just listen to a lot of music and I have friends with great taste in music, so I’ve been personally putting that song in my own playlist and DJ set for like four/five years now, I know it’s older than that, even just playing it and having people… What really set something off for me was having people in America come up to me and be like “Yo what was that song you just played?” and I would be like “man people really like that song but they don’t know it”. So I just, my brain started working of like how could I utilise a bit of it, there’s so many good pieces. So I introduced the concept to ‘85’ and I said to him like “man if we could make a beat, I don’t wanna do a cover I wanna write a whole new song, I just want Kyla to serve as the bridge or as a bridge to the next verse, or as a bridge to the next hook”, and he was like “alright alright cool” I had the beat for a while, I was just trying to figure it all out, and at that time I had met Wizkid through Skepta, cos we did a remix of one of Wizkid’s songs together and it just kinda all really fell into place naturally. And when it was all said and done, it was one of those moments much like ‘Hotline Bling’, I just didn’t really know how people were gonna feel about it, and that was part of the reason why I dropped ‘Pop Style’ along with it, cos I was kinda almost nervous like man I don’t know, this is just so different, let me just make sure I drop a rap record, so people just know I’m still on my shit. And I remember Boi1da had walked into the studio one night and he had heard ‘One Dance’ and he just looked at me and he’s like “man that’s gonna be the biggest song of your career to date” and I was like “c’mon man it’s like, that’s a lot to say, we hope it does well”. And yeah he was right, and it was just the perfect marriage of a lot of things, so many thank you’s to Kyla for being so supportive, she came out to South Africa and shot a movie with us for this song, and you know of course Wizkid doing his thing, and yeah just the entire UK for supporting it and the world for being open to listening to it I love that tempo, I love that cadence, those melodies, that’s the music that makes me happy in life, so it was great to just be able to just make something like that and shine light on a song from the UK that deserves it, because that’s truly a classic song  With ‘Pop style’ what happened with that, because when I got it originally it was Jay-Z and Kanye on it and they kinda weren’t on it?  Yeah, I was dealing directly with Ye and that’s the version that he sent me and that was what we talked about and he was like “man you know this is like ‘Pop Style’ featuring the throne, this is huge” and I was excited obviously anybody would be excited to see them link back up. And then I didn’t know what I was gonna hear. So when I heard Jay had two bars, I was like alright it is what it is, it’s cool I like that, it’s a little intro and Kanye goes off. And then you know I’m not really sure the details between how that conversation was miscommunicated or what they were going through at that time, or what anybody felt towards me or whatever it was, I’m not really sure but next thing I knew it just became a bit of an issue. And you know from there I don’t waste too much time, so I just was like alright cool I’ll finish it, I can rap as good as anybody else, so I’ll just go finish this song and put forth my own version cos I don’t really like… you know no one can dangle anything over my head in this business, I don’t play that. So it just needed to be done and I did it myself and yeah both versions exist, so when Kanye comes out to do it at the shows it goes crazy. I know he was really upset cos at that time we were working together pretty heavy and he really wanted to be on the record but you know… On the Pablo tour, he said a lot of things that are well documented but he said, before the last show, he was talking about how he was sick of not being able to do certain things everyone should come together and just make music. Is it digital politics now that prevents things from happening?  I don’t know, I think everybody has their own little things going on, I’m not really sure what he’s referring to half the time, cos in the same breath, I went from being… like working on a project with him, to him sorta publicly shitting on me and DJ Khaled for being on the radio too much. But yeah I’m not really sure, everybody’s got their own thing going on. Again me when I hear that, I just distance myself from it you know, alright if that’s what it is I don’t really even understand the point you’re trying to make but whatever it is that you’re going through, I accept it, I don’t respect it at all. You know cos I feel like me and Khaled are just good people, I’m not sure why we’re the target of your choice that you made that night. And yeah I accept what you’re going through, and I just go and continue working on my own thing. You know the more and more this progresses, the more and more I just feel like keeping to myself, cos its just so unpredictable, you never know which way people are gonna go. I mean streaming is the new record business, so yeah I guess you could call it digital politics, that’s kinda a good name for a song, I might have to do that when I get upstairs  So with ‘Childs Play’ another banger, there’s a line on there where you say why you acting light? What does that mean?  Oh you mean “I’m acting like I’m light skin”, that line (laughs), that’s just sorta something people… that’s like very an American thing people say like ‘ah man’ you’re being light-skinned”, I guess they say it’s like ‘emotional’ you know. I just think it’s a ridiculous stereotype, but I was just kinda playing on the irony of it, cos I’m actually light skinned so it made me laugh so I said it. But yeah it’s just a silly stereotype in black American culture, that light-skinned guys are this way or that way, so that was just a little joke  When did you first experience racism, you’re coming from a dual heritage, your fathers black, your mothers white, it puts you in a predicament, when was the first time you really noticed you get it from both sides, or one side or the other?  Man you know, I’ve really been grateful in my life to be born in Canada and just the journey that I had growing up was so… it was just a very accepting journey. I always had friends from all different backgrounds, from different walks of life, we all get along, I never really notice colour, religion, we don’t live like that. There’s really not that much segregation in Canada, and especially in Toronto, it’s like a cultural mosaic. And I know I’ve said that time and time again, but it truly is, it’s made up of so many beautiful people from beautiful places and you get to actually learn and you don’t ever develop hate. You know, the first time I really experienced it, was when I got famous and went to America and people would challenge me, like I don’t understand how it works or like “your Canadian, you’ll never understand, like the Black American struggle, or you’ll never under…..” That was the first time I really got challenged, and it was by people I had met from America that were like even close to me at the time You know, if I ever feel anything or if I ever feel like an outsider, it’s usually because I’m not American to be honest with you, that’s when I feel like people are against me or they feel like I’m not part of the…. I guess it’s got something to do with the fact that I have quite an eclectic make up, I am mixed, I am Jewish. Yeah but I feel like, at the end of the day when it comes to everything else I’m Black. I am referred to as a Black artist, last night at that Awards show, I’m a Black artist. I’m apparently a ‘rapper’ even though ‘Hotline Bling’ is not a rap song. The only category that they can manage to fit me in is a ‘rap’ category, maybe because I’ve rapped in the past, or because I’m Black, I can’t figure out why. Just like I can’t figure out why ‘One Dance’ wasn’t nominated, maybe because they can’t… I mean, well it’s just there’s pop obligations that they have and I fluked out, I fluked out and got one of the biggest songs of the year that is a pop song and I’m proud of that, you know. I love the rap world, I love the rap community, but you’re right I write pop songs for a reason, I wanna be like Michael Jackson, I wanna be like artists that I looked up to, those are pop songs but I never get any credit to that And shout out… and by the way I’m speaking to you as a winner from last night, I won two awards last night, but I don’t even want them, cos it feels weird for some reason, it doesn’t feel right to me. I feel almost like alienated or you’re tryna purposely alienate me by making me win rap awards, or either just pacify me by handing me something, putting me in that category, cos it’s the only place you can figure out where to put me. And remember they don’t decide the winners, but they do decide the nominations so they have to play it politically. And shout out to Chance, for last night, like I said I’m speaking from a winners point of view and I’m so happy for him, I’m not talking about.. I’m not angry about how last night worked out. But when you ask me like where, like do I feel, like racism, or do I feel it the same as everyone else, yeah I feel it, I notice it going on in it’s own places. But thankfully I get to be around the greatest group of people, my friends are from all over the place, they like Lebenese, they’re.. I’m Jewish, most of my friends are from the Islands of Jamaica, English, so I mean, we just don’t really notice it like that until I start talking about the music business Yeah it’s a really tough time in the world and again that statement has been said over and over again and I think we know it’s a tough time and I’m …  How did it feel to be on stage in Manchester when the Grammy’s were going on, you stuck to the tour.. Yeah I mean I did it because that at the end of the day is what matters to me that’s real life you know. I was pitched by the Grammy’s to cancel those two shows and fly and go sit in the audience to lose because they don’t air the other rap awards on TV. So I would have left 30,000 people hanging to sit there and just be there for their own ratings you know. The worst part is I expressed myself, like man I’m really thankful I was at those shows in Manchester cos those were two of the strongest shows that we’ve had so far. I texted somebody from the Grammys and was like I’m really glad I stayed behind, I really don’t wanna have this conversation about coming out there again and I got a text back that said ‘Blame It On Donald Trump’ – and I’m not gonna say who it is that I’m texting but this is like the institution, we’ve been conditioned to think that this it the true award for our accomplishments, for our music. By the way if you had a night like Chance last night, he deserves it, for his friends, for his family, for his collaborators, its amazing when they champion you. But all I’m saying is, to kids that will be coming up in the future and might now get championed or might not get that moment, that’s OK too. Because you have to realise what institution you’re dealing with. You’re dealing with a bunch of people that are just people at the end of the day and they’re either good people to the core or bad people to the core and we’ll never know. But I mean yeah, I was really glad that I was in Manchester last night, and like I said I’m speaking from the perspective of a winner, I won two awards, it’s just it really put it all in perspective for that thank God that I stayed here and did what I’m supposed to be doing for the people that actually care about my music, you know. Yeah man, that’s just kinda how I feel about that about this given timeEmbed"

153,Drake,N/A,ESPYs Conference Call (Ft. ESPN),NA,"You’re so vocal about how much you care about your hometown of Toronto and how much your friends and crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city. Can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like LeBron to make that decision, and that ultimate responsibility? Drake: Yeah, I mean, I think that for the last week and a half I’ve probably been bothering LeBron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be. I think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life he’s in. I don’t think that there’s a better way to deal with it than how he just did. I think if we can give out an award at the ESPYS for incredible essay writing, I would definitely love to present that to him because I think what he just did was patriotic in its own way, was courageous and was just, to me, I think it’s going to be one of the most historic things of our generation. I’m just honored to know him and glad that I’ve gotten to, no pun intended, witness this moment for sure. I think it’s an incredible thing.  I actually woke up kind of late today, so I’m just catching on. It’s a great feeling for me. I can’t wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud I am because he’s been a friend of mine for a long time. Shell: Obviously, you’ve joined Saturday Night Live and we’ve had Justin Timberlake host the show. Are you going to take a more musical approach to the ESPYS than what we’ve seen in the past? Drake: I think obviously one of the talents that I’m able to bring to the ESPYS is music, but I’m just going to get up there and I want to just prepare a great night for people. I think we have prepared an incredible night for people. I definitely want to incorporate music, but I’m not there to put on a strictly music‑based show. Yeah, we definitely have some incredible pre‑tapes. Yeah, I think it’s just going to be a great night overall. I’m there to deliver a great hosting job. Shell: What makes the perfect ESPYS host? We’ve seen some amazing people like Justin Timberlake and John Hamm and even LeBron James. What strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer? Drake: Well, I think what makes a perfect ESPYS host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats. But I think most importantly what I bring is the fact that I feel that I know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys I have personal relationships with. I think I’m going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that I don’t know. To me, it’s just about knowing the room that you’re in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve. Shell: Hosting a sports awards show, what do you feel is music’s role in sports? Drake: Well I said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go. I think that when I speak to any of my friends that play sports they’re always super into music, whether it be rap or other genres. My dream in life or my other dream in life that I’ll obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league, so I think they’re synonymous in that way. We inspire each other, and I think that’s what really ties music and sports together. Shell: This is a question for the producer, and if possible I have a follow‑up for Drake. With the LeBron news and the decision that was so successful for ESPN, was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the ESPYS? Did anybody reach out? Were you close? Maura Mandt: No, there was not an attempt to have that be there. And with the decision, it wasn’t something we were looking to have that announcement be on the ESPYS. Certainly if LeBron wanted to announce on the ESPYS, I would have happily had him there. I think what the ESPYS is about is the sports world plays out over the year, and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective, and that’s what you look for the host for. We’re going to be reflecting on the year, and LeBron is something that happened, so it will definitely be something that we’ll address in the show. But just like in sports, we don’t try to make that news happen. It unfolds. Shell: Drake, in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance, and a lot of times in hip‑hop that’s kind of also a part of rap music and it’s always been. Do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage, whether it be metaphorically or outright in hip‑hop? Drake: I think that’s a funny question. I think it’s a good fit. I definitely think that hip‑hop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for. I think we’re not trying to end people’s careers or make people feel bad in any way, and that’s kind of most of the time what problems in hip‑hop are about. So our night, like I said, is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports. So, yeah, I think there is definitely a difference. Though being clever with words is being clever with words, so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has. But I think the end goals are a bit different. Shell: You’re also being aware of public perception. For instance, you Instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer, right, and you so like you definitely have, I don’t know how to put it, maybe a love triangle thing going on with Skylar and she’ll probably be there. Can we expect a joke or where you’ll mention it like you did with SNL when you did the whole dated Rihanna thing? Everyone loved it, so can we expect that now that you’ll be hosting the ESPYS? Drake: Well, I obviously don’t want to give away the material. But I do have a growing affection for Skylar, and I’m not sure she’ll be able to make it, but I’m sure I’ll give you a treat if you enjoy my past references. I’m sure, if I haven’t done it already, now that I know you’re looking for it, I might stick one in there, for sure. You never know. Shell: One of the things about ESPN and the ESPYS is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the build‑up.  Today, I don’t know if you realize this, but you’ve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that Chris Brown posted up. I just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means? Drake: Well, as far as the latter end of the question, I’d rather not comment on it, but I know that our goal is obviously the night of the ESPYS to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards. I think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet. That’s why I’m excited. We’ve been working hard, like I said, on the pre‑tapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night, which I can 100% guarantee it will. Shell: Is Cleveland your new favorite sports city? How are you going to incorporate A. Wiggins, Manziel, and LB James into your ESPY segment? Drake: First of all, I’d like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks, I do not team jump. I’ve been ‑‑ in the past, I’ve always supported the player and not the institution unless it’s the Kentucky Wildcats or the Toronto Raptors. Those are two teams that I will never stray from. But what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer, whether it comes to football or obviously basketball, I have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams. So it’s not that I’m team jumping, I’m just a supportive friend. With the recent news, of course I’m going to go ‑‑ of course I’m going to go watch games in Cleveland. If not for LeBron, who like I said has been a brother to me for years, I mean, we’ve got three kids from Toronto on one team, plus we have Manziel who, again, is part of our family and like a brother. So I definitely have to look into some real estate in Cleveland and maybe make some trips this year. I might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best. But, yeah, like I said, my teams will always forever be who they are, but, yes, I will support the group that has shifted to Cleveland. I think that for Cleveland, a place that I’ve been time and time again touring, I just think it’s going to be greet. I really would love to see that city grow because they’re just a supportive group of people, and it is a great place, so I’m really excited. Shell: So the ESPYS is your second host gig this year. SNL was amazing by the way. So is hosting something that you’re trying to do more of or are you just working on more music? You have a lot to write about now that you’re a bachelor again. Drake: Well, actually, my status hasn’t changed, just to clear that up. I’ve always been out here coasting. But aside from that, the ESPYS is my main focus like SNL. When I commit to something, I don’t let my focus stray. So for Maura to give me this opportunity to host, I don’t take it lightly. I put everything on hold to be ‑‑ to give the best performance that I possibly can at this awards show, and then from there, I have things coming up, whether it’s the OVO Fest or the tour with Lil Wayne, which is a real thing, which a lot of people don’t know if it’s a real thing or not, but it’s very real and it’s going to be very competitive. And then from there, I’ll figure out the next steps for me. I’m always working on new music, but the ESPYS is the main focus right now, and we’ll figure out what’s next afterwards. Shell: One thing we learned about you after hosting SNL is you’re a tremendous impressionist. I personally loved the Katt Williams and Lil Wayne.  With having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience, can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show?  Drake: Yeah, I’m actually excited to say that I definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance, and that is something that I actually pride in that I studied for. I love finding a character and getting into that character, especially if I know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms. So, yes, I will be doing impressions during the ESPYS, and they’re good. I’m excited.  They’re great. Shell: Are you bringing your lint roller? Drake: Oh, yes. I think I’ll probably have it somewhere around. Maybe I should. I should bring it out on stage. You shouldn’t have said it on the call. You should have anonymously sent that tip in, maybe we would have used the joke. No, I think I’ll be lint‑free that night. I’ll have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit. Shell: So we know that you wore some custom Calvin Klein outfits for your tour. Are you planning on the same fashion wearing any Calvin Klein suits, and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what they’re going to wear? Drake: I’m not exactly sure what brands I’m going to be wearing. Right now I’m sort of still, like I said, very focused on the show. I’ll figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers I’ll be wearing. But I’m more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that I’ll be draped in for you all to admire. So that’s really what my main focus is, but I’ll get my suits together. I’m also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself. I might just cut to somebody and I won’t have to say anything. Shell: You have so many relationships with a lot of athletes. Is there anyone in particular that you haven’t met yet that you’re looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that you’re with already given you any advice about hosting? Drake: Well, I mean, I’ve gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends. You know, one of my mentors who is not an athlete, but obviously Jamie Foxx, a previous host and a big reason why I asked to be a part of this, just because that performance that he gave, I believe he hosted twice or three times, oh, twice, right. It was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music, but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was. So his mentorship and advice has been great to me. Is there anybody that I’m looking forward to meeting? I mean, yeah, I was going to say, I’ve never met Skylar. I’m sure it will be extremely awkward when I do. But I guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up, which she probably won’t. Her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something. But, yeah, if I ever get to meet her I probably owe her an apology right off the bat. It’s been all in good spirits. But, yeah, that is the one person I’d like to meet. Just for that last person, I also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music. I want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down. Yeah, Nick whatever his name is, because he didn’t win, so that’s how he’s going to be remembered. Nick whatever his name is. Shell: Can you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you, and how many are coming from the writing staff? Also, if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song? Drake: Oh, very good double question. Well, for the first part, the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible. We have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady Maura all the way down to the writers and everybody that’s involved. Everyone involved has been incredible to work with. We’ve been at it now for three months, I think, just on and off, meeting and talking and brain storming. As far as ideas being mine, I am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that I submitted are what I’m going to be performing or delivering on Wednesday night. Whether it be music, jokes and pre‑taped pieces, I was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it. Is writing a joke harder than writing a song? I think that because of the way I write songs which is very honest, raw emotion about my life, I think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because it’s just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding Drake song as the public would deem it. But, yeah, I mean, all my music is so honest, that sometimes it’s hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself. When you’re able to be lighthearted and joke around, I enjoy it. It comes a little quicker than songs do. Mandt: I’d like to make a comment on the collaboration process. Having worked on the show a number of years, one of the things that really resonates in the content is when it’s authentic from the person delivering it. Being able to have the access we’ve had to Drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on what’s coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life, it really elevates it, so it’s definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved. We had a shoot the other day from one of the skits, and on set he was coming up with stuff, and you guys will see it and know what I’m talking about when you see the show. But there was no script in certain areas of it. It was really like an improv session, and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see. I’m really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show.1Embed"

354,Drake,N/A,New Album Titled 'Views From The 6',NA,"The meaning of the album title is unclear, but the announcement is just one part of what will be a busy summer for the rapper. On July 16th, Drake will host ESPN's ESPY Awards at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, where the ceremony will be televised live at 9 p.m. EST on the sports channel. The show intends to celebrate the best moments in sports with music, comedy bits and appearances by famous athletes. Later in the month, Drake's label OVO Sound will release two records by artists he signed. Majid Jordan will put out A Place Like This on July 22nd, and PARTYNEXTDOOR will release PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO on the 29th. Drake recently made a guest appearance on the latter artist's ""Recognize,"" streaming below via Rap-Up, which will appear on the album. Drake will then stage OVO Fest in Toronto on August 3rd and 4th, when Outkast will perform and he will do his own set, with appearances by yet-to-be-confirmed special guests. This year, OVO Fest was awarded a CAN $300,000 government grant, which amounts to roughly US $268,000, as part of an initiative to help out festivals in Ontario. A press release claims the festival has sold out of the fest's 35,000 tickets.5Embed"

657,Drake,N/A,Zane Lowe Interview (Ft. Zane Lowe),NA," Alright, this is it right? We are rolling and we're recording, let's begin. This is a very special broadcast of OVO Sound Radio right here, Beats 1, Apple Music.  Long time coming man.  Long time coming man...long time coming, an exciting time, an exciting night for obvious reasons. Any way, man, here we are in the Safe House this is kind of...I suppose the official home of OVO Sound, this is the heart now of OVO Sound, here in Toronto, OVO house based in Toronto. Uhm...It's 40's spot, where the music gets made. 40's...uh  what do they call it, like a brain child, brain child? This is 40's creation from the ground up...I mean I was here, man, when there were no walls. I was here when there was no...not even a hint of a studio, or any...and uhm, he saw it through to the end. I mean, incredible execution on a vision that he had from the very...very early on. I know he's always...he's always enjoyed living in the same space that he works in. So he's been able to build this...build this complex that we utilize to get the job done, yeah. When you walked in here for this first time, because I always thinking like....rooms you can catch a vibe pretty quick Yeah  And you know 40 obviously build this, you were there for the process...and when, you know, he called you in for the first session...did you, did you catch a vibe? Did you record something that first night? I was here, uhm, I was here a few times as you know...I was here when this room first started functioning and everything else wasn't built. I think....I think maybe the first...one of the first things we did here that got released was probably ""Back to Back"" ironically enough, but I think that was kinda when we were kind of....That's how you, uh, that's how you broke the bottle on the bow? Haha that was like one of the first...  On that track? That was like one of the first thingsWow.  that we actually recorded and it...and it...Tangible energy from the get-go. I mean, you know, just...  Get it done. execution, man, just following suit. I watched 40 execute so I had to come in here and execute too, that's it.  How many visitors really...I mean I know there's a lot of people in here tonight for obvious reasons, because, you know, we're tryna capture something. You know...but, uhm, you know, when it's, when it's... business time, how many...how many visitors generally roll through here? Cause the vibe I get is you guys keep it pretty...pretty light. Yeah, I don't really. I'm not really into, like, a whole bunch of people and distraction, uhm...I have, you know, I have respect for everybody and their craft in whatever they do. So I expect the same thing when people come in here, I don't want a bunch of hustle and bustle, talking and...loud you know. And...and the other thing that's tough when you invite people in the studio...is they're obviously coming to watch something happen. Right. And...and it doesn't always happen every night.  You know...it's not like every night is some magic moment. I mean, there's nights of frustration, there's nights of nothingness, there's night of just...you know, uh...these little tactical, uh, things. That clinical, surgical edits and stuff that...it gets you know Housekeeping. Right. I pretty much gauge the, uhm... characters that are allowed to sit in here based off of how they conduct themselves on those type of nights.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think I have a pretty immediate, immediate team that is able to sit in here and I...I...I...I don't want to notice you, and that's not to be offensive,  I just don't want to know that you're here. I want to be able to...to get up and just go in there and spill you know. Not worry about people's feelings Yeah. or tensions or any of that, that makes perfect sense, you know. Today unless...you change your mind Laughing  the album's done It's done. 40 sent it while the game was on. It's crazy, I mean we're literally watching the Raptors while 40 was...you know... Mhm.  I think the line was  from Noel was ""right now we've been finished for seven seconds."" Yeah hahahahaha. Vincent like came in, he was like ""but nah, I sent the...I sent the email seven minutes ago, we've been finished for seven minutes."" And he want to his computer and he was like ""ah, I never sent it.""  The game clock was kinda measuring the album clock too you know, it's synonymous tonight. Oh man the world clock has been measuring the album now...and, and to a certain extent that's your fault. Cause back on August the 6th in 2014 you announced the name of the record. Yeah. Now...now I have...I spoke to your friend Skepta about announcing records prematurely.  Mhm. And he was pretty straight about it, he wish he hadn't done it. He felt the pressure of announcing Konichiwa way up front, added additional pressure to him. I mean...you did it almost two years before you delivered the record. How did it work for you making that announcement, you know... in 2014? I think the...the announcement was more than just the album title, it was just a shift in the city. You know, that we, uh...we saw an opening there. You know, it was, it was, the name took on a life of it's own. Uhm...and now the city is obviously referred to as, as what it is...Yeah.  Uhm...and yeah, I mean...I...we're...me and Oliver are always, are very cautious about that. Uh...we never wanna prematurely announce anything, but I kinda feel like, like it's crazy that you say two years cause t really doesn't feel like two years. I mean, yeah, I just had this plan to finish this album and then...but I, I remember I was like ""oh man, well you know, I'm gonna do a mixtape."" Just cause I'm just like at this place, where I'm..I'm in this hotel every night, I just wanna make rap music, and I always, always wanted to make a, a project with Boi-1da. Uh...just like, exclusively like his... his brand of music, like just hard ish, like uh...trying to snap as much as I could and get as many joints as I could in, in a short amount of time. Uhm...and so that's kind of, you know, I was really adamant about finishing that mixtape first and then I said, okay then I'll move on. I mean, when we...when we do these albums, and especially if it's me and 40...it's never not been me and 40...but, when me and 40 lock in.  We really lock in  ...yeah.  and we take it very seriously and it's not... it's not like some rush job, you know? We...we, we'll sit there and, and we...like I said some nights we don't even come here and make music some nights we just talk yeah... we talk and we listen and you know, we try and figure out, what...what the direction is and what...what works for me...  It seems to me,  that might be a distinction because you blur the lines so successfully, it helps in the evolution of mixtapes. They've been around in existence for a long time and yet when you started to do and some of your peers started to do it at a similar time, these mixtapes were becoming blockbusters in their own right. They weren't just moving the streets anymore, they were actually moving the sales and the charts and you were touring off the back of these things. Well, well that was it, I went...I wnt on a full-blown tour off of If You're Reading This It's Too Late....  It's crazy. ...and it went straight to iTunes  and I feel like that's like a...that's a hundred percent a possibility, same thing we do with a lot of the OVO Sound artists, you know, it's like, why not? You put all this time  and they're all original sounds, why should shouldn't it be able to be...you know, I understand, I understand...the...the joy of getting a free body of work from somebody, but you know, this is like one of the only platforms we have left to like generate interest and income and all these, you know, these...get the attention and make it that easy to access... and focus... as opposed to going to ten different places to try and find it once links are being you know...so I mean...  It's focusing your audience, isn't it  ultimately?  Yeah and that's really what it's about right now, is, is...and that's, I mean not to shamelessly plug but even...you know, what we've been doing with Apple Music and stuff like that...it's like you know, just focusing the audience and giving them a place to go and hone in on this one hub to go get everything. Uhm...but with that being said, you know, I...I finished that tape and I was really happy with it a lot of the songs got bigger than expected and we had to go do some shows... I wondered that...I wondered, you know, if it...I mean I know you dropped it in the early hours in the morning and it was just like ""Wake up surprise, here's a Drake record"" and everything else, but i know how I felt about that album and millions of other people do as well and that record has become, in many respects, a modern-day classic...and I wondered if that caught you off guard? Uhm...yeah I definitely...I definitely always just treated it like a mixtape. I...I was never...you know, even the difference between this album and that is like...the...the time we spent on the transitions, the layering of the production, the...the changes...just, just...sonically even, the time that 40 and Gadget put in...uhm, you know...this was just a tape that we did in my hotel room at the end of the day...Laughing so, I mean, it's...it's great that people love it, I mean, I always just looked at it as a bridge to get to where we're...we're at today. And then...and then from that, I mean, I ended up going to Atlanta and sitting with Future for six days and he's just a...  a monster  ...he's a machine, it's crazy, I've never seen anybody with that much of a catalog...like I mean, songs that I still think about to this day that I heard in that studio, that I'm like ""when is that coming out?"" Oh, I've seen him...I've seen people loading projects1Embed"
