0,Taylor Swift,N/A,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),NA,"Taylor: I mean, yeah, we could do that. We could do that, right? Yeah. I mean, did you have a fancy introduction planned? No? Did you have a song prepared? Do we really, well, funny you should mention - no, no song. No song prepared, that's not gonna - Not at all? And I came all the way to Canada. Focusing on the year 1989, it was a great year. Do you know what the Best Picture that year was? I do not. The movie that won Best Picture in 1989: Rain Man. Amazing! Good movie, right? Fantastic. Good movie. The Album of the Year, do you know the  that won a Grammy? It's the first time that this has happened, really, to you? Yeah. In an interview about an album called 1989? Well, I just figured you'd just want to show off your knowledge. Well, it's the internet, it's not really showing off. Okay. George Michael's Faith! Amazing! Album of the Year. This is actually educational. It's pretty good, right? But I was happy that it wasn't, like, there weren't too sketchy things. Those were really good things that stand up. Rain Man is still great to watch, Faith is still a fantastic album. ""Like a Prayer"" by Madonna came out in 1989, one of the most influential pop songs and music videos of all time. You were born. I was in 1989 for two weeks. Yeah, that's okay. That's okay. But it still happened in that year. It happened in 1989. You've only released a studio album four times previous to this, so this is something that doesn't happen to you all that often. So, the title of it - It's really important. The theme of it is really important, right? When was the moment you decided it was gonna be 1989? Actually, no one... this is why I like talking to you, because no one has ever come at it from this angle and actually asked me that specific question. It's actually a really interesting moment. I remember exactly when I decided that I was gonna call it 1989. It was the night of the Grammys this year. After the Grammys I didn't go to any afterparties or anything, I kind of wanted to go home and eat In-N-Out Burger with my friends. I remember going home and playing a lot of the new music I had recorded for some of my backup singers and one of my best friends. We were all sitting in the kitchen and I was playing them all this music, and they were just saying, ‘you know, this is very eighties. It’s very clear to us that this is so eighties.’ We were just talking and talking about how it’s kind of a rebirth in a new genre, how that’s a big bold step, how, kind of, starting a part of your career over. When they left that night, I just had this very clear moment of, ‘it’s gotta be called 1989. It's gotta be called that. We're talking about creative rebirth, my birth year, the album is eighties-influenced.' I didn't know I was doing that but I was doing that. You didn't know you were doing that? I didn't mean to do it, I just was doing it. And so, then, after that, I really was able to focus on the, kind of, eighties sonic concept. And then it really came together as a very sonically cohesive project. Were you still writing songs in the traditional way, with a guitar? Yes and no, I mean, some of them I wrote on piano, some of them I wrote on guitar. Some of them I would think of some synth line in my head and sing it into my phone and send it to my co-writers and say, ‘do you think this would sound cool?’ Like, without words, just singing the, kind of, synth line? Yeah! Or singing a drum beat over top of it, and I would send it to them and I'd go, ‘I don’t have the right keyboard to make this sound in my house. I just have a piano and a guitar, but let me play it for you on piano and let you know what I think the bassline should be, and we can start there.’ Or it would be a first line of a first verse, or it would be, sort of, an image that I wanted to create a feeling around. We would just start with this image I had, or a story. It was a lot different than making any of my other albums. It was? Yeah. Biggest difference was what? The biggest difference was that I didn't have any, I didn't have any boundaries around me production-wise. You know, one of my favorite things about country music is that it taught me how to tell stories. Coming up in the Nashville songwriting community was the greatest thing that could've ever happened to me because it taught me how to weave a story together with very, um, very detailed, personal details but also some, kind of, like, poetic, purple imagery. I love, kind of, I love how it all came about with my career, but at this point, it felt like I wanted to go and run in a direction that I had never run in before, which was, ""I wanna be able to use whatever instruments I want, whatever drum sounds I want, whatever vocal stylings I want. I want to build and layer things, and I don't want someone to say, 'well, this isn't country.'"" You know? And for me to be trying to prove that it was. So the reason this felt like a much more free experience was because I was able to write songs without the worry people would say it wasn't in the genre it was supposed to be in. So in labelling it pop and just calling it what it was, you know, when you make a pop album nobody's gonna look at it and say, ""well, that's not pop."" So I didn't have any restraints on me. Jason Aldean recently said something about how you're not gonna hear him writing a song about being a Wall Street stock broker because he doesn't even know where Wall Street's at, and that was the - He's gotta know where that is. I think he- It's in New York. That's where he keeps his money. He's gotta know. He knows where it's at. I think he was trying to say, just why - I get what he's trying to say, though. Sorry, I was just, like, my dad is a stock broker who would've just been, like, his brain would be, like,  I understand that that's his life and talking about, ""this is where I grew up, what I grew up knowing."" What you grew up knowing is much different. It's international. Yeah. It's the world. You've been traveling the world for a long time. I completely understand what he was saying there, because, I mean, with me, it's the same thing. It's like, as my life has changed, I need to continue to write about it, and I need to continue to write about even the things that change, like moving to New York and, you know, focusing more on my girlfriends rather than boyfriends. Like, these are things that are, kind of, the focal point of this new album. And as much of when I was in high school, I would sing about what my life was, which was, you know, sneaking out at night, and driving in trucks with your first boyfriend, and falling in love, and that, kind of, innocent summer romance thing, small towns, dirt roads. That was actually my life in high school. It's not anymore. So if I were to continue to write songs about that, I feel like it would be very disingenuous, and as a songwriter, that's the exact opposite of the goal I'm trying to accomplish. In listening to the songs I've heard already, they're still, they're very much story songs. You tell a story in each one. There's a beginning, a middle, and an end, and that's something that you focus on. Definitely. I mean, I think that's kind of engrained in me, and that's the one part of my songwriting that I don't think should change as everything else does. I think that my fans have gotten used to receiving my diary entries every two years, and getting that album and going, ""oh, this is what she's been through the last two years."" I meet a bunch of people who are in the public eye, but not quite like, there's nobody in the public eye like you. There's a few on the planet, and there's nothing that could prepare you for that. Am I right? There's nothing in life that could prepare you for that. I feel really lucky because I don't feel like I was shot out of a cannon, you know? A lot of people have their first single come out and it is everywhere, and all of a sudden they have a triple-platinum single, and there's all this anticipation about their album and then, all of a sudden, people start to tear them down, and it all happens over the course of six months to a year. My career build, I mean, we're going on, it's about nine years now since I put out my first album? The record label was signed in 2005, right? The record deal rather, sorry. We're going on almost ten years, so it's been a really, really gradual arc, and that doesn't mean that sometimes it doesn't feel that it's at a crazy fever pitch that no one could ever prepare you for, but as much as you could possibly be prepared for it, I feel like time has kind of prepared me for it. I mean, some days I wake up and am absolutely overwhelmed by how abnormal my life is. It's not normal to have security with you wherever you go. It's not normal to have assistants. It's not normal to have hair and makeup every day. It's not normal - To give you people heat for holding a cat a certain way on the streets of New York. That cat loves being held like that! I know! No, I know! But you can't do anything without somebody at some point on some website, ""well, the cat doesn't, this isn't right for the cat to be out like that."" The cat loves it. The cat, here's the thing - Is that Olivia? Yeah, that's Olivia. Yeah, you're right, exactly. And when everything that you do is debated upon, scrutinized, questioned, everybody feels entitled to ask you why you did everything. There are days where I feel really, really okay with that, honestly, but then there are days where I just, am kind of overwhelmed by all of it, and I think that that's okay. I try to encourage my fans that they don't have to feel confident every day, they don't have to feel happy every day, they don't have to feel pretty every day, they don't have to feel wanted every day. That they shouldn't put added, extra pressure on themselves to feel happy when they're not, you know? I think being honest with yourself emotionally is really important. When you signed that record deal in 2005, is there any advice you would go back and give to that girl that was signing that day? Or because the slow and gradual build it kind of worked out? I mean, it's obviously all worked out okay. What advice are you gonna give to somebody like that? I don't think I'd wanna give her too much advice, I would... oh, I think I would tell her to laugh more. Just, you know, if you laugh at yourself first it's less funny when other people make fun of you. I would also explain to her the actual definition of feminism, because I didn't know it when I was younger. I think those are two important things for girls to know, going into this business or going into life itself. But all the other things, all the really intense, times I felt serious pain or rejection or humiliation or embarrassment, those have all produced the songs I'm the most proud of. There was this crazy circumstance that happened where I wrote this song ""Mean"" about the harshest criticisms I've ever gotten. It was brutal. And that song ended up winning two Grammys. Spectacular, yeah. In hindsight you don't , but if you knew something was coming, if someone said to you, ""there's something coming around the corner, it's brutal, you're gonna want to, you know, hoodie for three weeks, you're never gonna want to deal with it. But the result will be Album of the Year."" Oh my God, you'd do anything for that! Fair enough. Like I said earlier, this is one of the things you don't get to do all the time. You get to go on stage a lot, you get to be interviewed a lot, all of these things happen to you, but album releases don't happen a lot. They don't. They don't happen a lot. I'm really soaking it in. Yeah? Do you still get as excited? I know you were saying you're more proud of this than any of them. Yeah. I'm so excited, I mean, honestly. Because having spent the last year and a half, just kind of living my life on my own terms and not, not dating, not focusing on really anything else other than figuring out the album I wanted to make, there's such an incentive for me, like, I'm so proud of it. And I've always been proud of my albums, but there's something about this one, where I feel like I actually did something different this time. I actually made something that is cohesive and fits together and has its own sound and something I was so focused on. And I can be focused on my fans, and I can, you know, like, I'm not tired right now during this interview. Like, I'm not distracted, I'm just, kind of, I'm just, really taking it in. The highs that you get on stage, almost nobody gets to experience, what you experience on stage. Which, again on the planet. You have one of those jobs that's very rare. What's second to that? What's the thing that comes the closest to the electricity that you feel when you're on stage? I would say it's different all the time, but right now it's, like, seasonal stuff. Like, I get as excited about being on stage as I get about cozy things. Because just the idea of seasons changing. This is the time of year where I'm so out-of-control excited about the fact that it's fall. Guess what's next? Winter. Yes, so you're gonna have a hard time getting anybody here excited about that. It's two seasons that I love, and I can bake stuff all the time, and then I can give it to people. I can try out new recipes, I can wear sweaters, I can wear knee socks. I could even buy sweaters for my cats to wear. Okay. I could do any of that, because it's that kind of season! But that's almost as exciting as being on stage in front of forty thousand people? You have to understand that if you're choosing your first place as being something like, ""ahhhhhhh,"" the second place has to be something that evens that out, which is, like, baking day with your friends. But your answer really is, ""I don't need another high like that, because that's the one I get by going on stage."" I think that is actually my revised answer. You mentioned feminism. You have, almost by happy accident, become a real icon for girls and women, and you said earlier that that would be one of the things you might make sure you would change if you were to go back and talk to younger you, is to, kind of, narrow down that definition, or define the definition of feminism. Do you realize, kind of, how great that it is for young girls to see what you're doing? I mean, you get to experience that , right? When you talk to parents of young girls, right? That's awesome. It's interesting because I think that feminism is such an important conversation to be having. Especially right now, because with girls out there in the world living their lives, knowing what it means is so important, because all it means is that they feel they should be treated exactly the same way as guys. They should be given equal opportunities and rights. And I think the more people like Lena  talk about it, like, Lorde and Emma Watson talk about it, and the fact that it's becoming, sort of, a conversation that is top-of-mind in the media. I think it's so incredible. I've always made music so I could feel camaraderie with my fans, not in a way that was trying to cater to, kind of, any male fantasy, and that wasn't on purpose, that's just been what has felt natural to me. When asked early on about feminism in my career, I just, I think I was probably fifteen the first time I was asked about it. And so I would just say, ""I don't talk about politics, I don't really understand that stuff yet, so I guess I'm just gonna say I'm not."" And I wish that when I was younger I would've known that it's simply hoping for gender equality. Probably not so fair of the interviewer to ask a fifteen-year-old about that. You know, that's an interesting point to make. But I think that, in the media, it's very interesting to witness, on a daily basis. You know, you go online, and we all see these gossip blogs every single time we log on, because we're curious and that's the society we live in. But you'll see these polls, like, ""vote on who has a better butt! This woman or this woman?"" And you never see ""who has a better butt: this man or this man?"" It just never happens. ""Who's the hotter mama: this woman or this woman?"" It's not, like, ""who's the sexiest dad: this man or this man?"" You just don't see it. And people are allowed to pit women against each other and vote, and they think it's an innocent thing, when really it's kind of warping your mind that, you know. And if a young girl logs on and votes, it's like she's going, ""oh my God, if that girl in my class is pretty and smart, then maybe everyone's comparing me to her, and maybe I should hate her."" And that's just, it's feeding this negativity and I really think that with girls, kind of, banding together, in music, in culture, in movies, whatever. I think it's nice to see people actually cheer each other on and girls be friends with each other, because hopefully that will kind of bleed into the classroom, and the playground, and the campus, and all that. I know it seems like disposable entertainment for adults, but it's not only adults who are seeing this stuff. It's mostly not adults. It's mostly not adults. It's mostly very impressionable kids and young girls who are still forming their ideas of who they actually are. And to warp their opinions of other girls, that just adds anxiety to their life that they don't need. This kind of brings me to talking about your legacy, and I know, I think five albums in it's appropriate to start talking a little bit about that. I'm guessing that you try very hard to make sure that the music you make, you release the things you take part in enough, that they'll all be able to stand up. Not just to the test of time, say, sonically or whatever, but that you can continue to be proud of this, is that right? Yeah, it's completely right, it's dead-on. I've always had this thing where I think about what, if I'm lucky enough to have grandkids someday, what they would say. If they looked back on pictures, and videos, and things like that, and I'd sure they'd laugh at me and make fun of my awkwardness and things like that. But I would never want to embarrass them. It's interesting because it's like the whole role model question, like, are you a role model? Do you think about the little kids in the front row when you're doing all the things you're doing in this life? I think that's an unnecessary pressure to put on yourself, but it's easier when you make it about your own life, your own legacy, when you, kind of, bring it in house, and you're, like, ""what if I have a five-year-old someday? And what if someday my ten-year-old goes online for the first time? Like, what do I want her to see about me?"" That's a pretty good way to look at it. It's something that happens very naturally where if you're, kind of, just taking accountability and responsibility for your own actions, it's kind of a natural thing that happens, where, you know, all of a sudden you have parents coming up and thanking you, and you're just, sort of, like, ""hm, well, you're welcome."" Where you were just, kind of, trying to live a good life, because I think, you know, you don't want to feel like you're the national president of the babysitters club, but you do wanna try to do good things, and make ripples, and good echoes in society, and culture, and all that. But you are doing that, and in the music that I've heard already, man, are people gonna get a kick out of hearing this, and experiencing it live. It's great, congratulations on this. Good. Thank you! It's epic. The album's out. Thank you! It's great to talk to you, as always. As always. Thanks, Taylor. Awesome. Nice job. Thanks! You're so good! Thank you, thank you for doing this. I always end up telling you stuff that I've never thought to say in interviews.1Embed"
1,Taylor Swift,1989,1989 [Liner Notes],NA,"I was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on December 13, 1989. In the world we live in, much is said about when we are born and when we die. Our birthday is celebrated every year to commemorate the very instant we came into the world. And a funeral is held to mark the day we leave it. But lately I've been wondering... what can be said of all the moments in between our birth and our death? The moments when we are reborn... The debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all I ever do is change. All I ever do is learn from my mistakes so I don't make the same ones again. Then I make new ones. I know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day. Every day I wake up as someone slightly new. Isn't it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new? For the last few years, I've woken up every day not wanting, but needing to write a new style of music. I needed to change the way I told my stories and the way they sounded. I listened to a lot of music from the decade in which I was born and I listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling. I was also writing a different storyline than I'd ever told you before. I wrote about moving to the loudest and brightest city in the world, the city I had always been overwhelmed by... until now. I think you have to know who you are and what you want in order to take on New York and all its blaring truth. I wrote about the thrill I got when I finally learned that love, to some extent, is just a game of cat and mouse. I wrote about looking back on a lost love and understanding that nothing good comes without loss and hardship and constant struggle. There is no ""riding off into the sunset,"" like I used to imagine. We are never out of the woods, because we are always going to be fighting for something. I wrote about love that comes back to you just when you thought it was lost forever, and how some feelings never go out of style. I wrote about an important lesson I learned recently... that people can say whatever they want about me, but they can't make me lose my mind. I've learned how to shake things off. I've told you my stories for years now. Some have been about coming of age. Some have been about coming undone. This is a story about coming into your own, and as a result... coming alive. I hope you know that you've given me the courage to change. I hope you know that who you are is who you choose to be, and that whispers behind your back don't define you. You are the only person who gets to decide what you will be remembered for. From the girl who said she would never cut her hair or move to New York or find happiness in a world where she is not in love... Love, Taylor1.

2,Taylor Swift,1989 (Taylor’s Version) [Tangerine Edition],1989 (Taylor’s Version) [Prologue],NA,"How does a person reinvеnt herself, you ask? In any way I could think of. Musically, geographically, aesthetically, behaviorally, motivationally... And I did so joyfully. The curiosity I had felt the first murmurs of while making Red amplified into a pulsing heartbeat of restlessness in my ears. The risks I took when I toyed with pop sounds and sensibilities on Red? I wanted to push it further. The sense of freedom I felt when traveling to big bustling cities? I wanted to live in one. The voices that had begun to shame me in new ways for dating like a normal young woman? I wanted to silence them. You see—in the years preceding this, I had become the target of slut-shaming—the intensity and relentlessness of which would be criticized and called out if it happened today, the jokes about my amount of boyfriends. The trivialization of my songwriting as if it were a predatory act of a boy crazy psychopath, the media co-signing of this narrative. I had to make it stop because it was starting to really hurt. It became clear to me that for me there was no such thing as casual dating, or even having a male friend who you platonically hang out with. If I was seen with him, it was assumed I was sleeping with him. And so I swore off hanging out with guys, dating, flirting, or anything that could be weaponized against me by a culture that claimed to believe in liberating women but consistently treated me with the harsh moral codes of the Victorian Era. Being a consummate optimist, I assumed I could fix this if I simply changed my behavior. I swore off dating and decided to focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships. If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn’t sensationalize or sexualize that—right? I would learn later on that people could and people would. But none of that mattered then because I had a plan and I had a demeanor as trusting as a basket of golden retriever puppies. I had the keys to my own apartment in New York and I had new melodies bursting from my imagination. I had Max Martin and Shellback who were happy to help me explore this new sonic landscape I was enamored with. I had a new friend named Jack Antonoff who had made some cool tracks in his apartment. I had the idea that the album would be called 1989 and we would reference big 80s synths and write sky high choruses. I had sublime, inexplicable faith and I ran right toward it, in high heels and a crop top. There was so much that I didn't know then, and looking back I see what a good thing that was. This time of my life was marked by right kind of naïveté, a hunger for adventure, and a sense of freedom I hadn't tasted before. It turns out that the cocktail of naïveté, hunger for adventure and freedom can lead to some nasty hangovers, metaphorically speaking. Of course everyone had something to say, but they always will. I learned lessons, paid prices, and tried to... Don't say it... Don't say it... I'm sorry, I have to say it... Shake it off. I'll always be so incredibly grateful for how you loved and embraced this album. You, who followed my zig zag creative choices and cheered on my risks and experiments. You, who heard the wink and humor in ""Blank Space"" and maybe even empathized with the pain behind the satire. You, who saw the seeds of allyship and advocating for equality in ""Welcome To New York."" You, who knew that maybe a girl who surrounds herself with female friends in adulthood is making up for a lack of them in the childhood (Not starting a tyrannical hot girl cult). You, who saw that I reinvent myself for a million reasons, and that one of them is to try my very best to entertain you. You, who have had the grace to allow me the freedom to change. I was born in 1989, reinvented for the first time in 2014, and a part of me was reclaimed in 2023 with the re-release of this album I love so dearly. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine the magic you would sprinkle on my life for so long. This moment is a reflection of the woods we've wandered through and all this love between us still glowing in the darkest dark. I present to you, with gratitude and wild wonder, my version of 1989. It's been waiting for you. Taylor1Embed"

6,Taylor Swift,N/A,2021 BRIT Global Icon Award Speech,NA,"I wanna thank the BRITs, or anyone who decided that I would be worthy of this incredible honor. I'm really really proud to be a part of this musical community, especially in a year where we all needed music so much, but what we needed even more was the help and support we got from the NHS and the key workers who are here tonight. Thank you for everything that you've done for us. This is a really cool one, I love this! I am so indebted to and grateful for my British fans, I love you so much for everything you've done for me. We've had so many amazing memories inn the last 15 years, from playing Shepherd's Bush Empire, to playing the O2 Arena, to playing Wembley Stadium, and hey, because of you, last year I almost played Glastonbury so. But, we all know what happened next, the world changed and I ended up putting out three albums instead. Making folklore and evermore was one of the most unique, cathartic, extraordinary experiences I've ever had. I would love the opportunity to thank the amazing creative people that I made those albums with. Thank you Aaron Dessner, thank you Jack Antonoff, Joe, Justin Vernon, The National, Marcus Mumford, Jon Low, Serban Ghenea, Laura Sisk, and HAIM. I wanna thank my friends and family, who know exactly who they are, whose opinion of me never changed whether my stock was up or down, if there's one thing that I've learned it's that you have to look around you everyday and take note of the people who have always believed in you, and never stop appreciating them for it, never take them for granted. There are so many incredible new artists in this room tonight, and a lot of people watching who have goals and ambitions and dreams for themselves. I need you to hear me when I say there is no career path that comes free of negativity. If you're being met with resistance, that probably means that you're doing something new. If you're experiencing turbulence or pressure, that probably means you're rising. And there might be times when you put your whole heart and soul into something and it is met with cynicism or skepticism. You cannot let that crush you, you have to let it fuel you, because we live in a world where anyone has the right to say anything that they want about you at anytime. But just please remember that you have the right to prove them wrong. I love you all thank you so much for this beautiful honor, thank you to the BRITs! This is amazing.Embed"
7,Taylor Swift,N/A,2022 New York University Commencement Speech,NA,"As for me, I'm 90% sure the main rеason I'm here is becausе I have a song called ""22."" And let me just say, I am elated to be here with you today as we celebrate and graduate New York University's Class of 2022. Not a single one of us here today has done it alone. We are each a patchwork quilt of those who have loved us, those who have believed in our futures, those who showed us empathy and kindness, or told us the truth, even when it wasn't easy to hear. Those who told us we could do it when there was absolutely no proof of that. Someone read stories to you, and taught you to dream, and offered up some moral code of right and wrong for you to try and live by. Someone tried their best to explain every concept in this insanely complex world to the child that was you as you asked a bazillion questions, like, ""How does the moon work?"" and ""Why can we eat salad, but not grass?"" And maybe they didn't do it perfectly — no one ever can —, maybe they aren't with us anymore, in that case, I hope you'll remember them today. If they are in this staium, I hope you'll find your own way to express your gratitude for all the steps, and missteps, that have led us to this common destination. I know that words are supposed to be my thing, but I will never be able to find the words to thank my mom and dad, and my brother, Austin, for the sacrifices they made every day, so I could go from singing in coffeehouses to standing up here with you today, because no words would ever be enough. To all the incredible parents, family members, mentors, teachers, allies, friends, and loved ones here today who have supported these students in their pursuit of educational enrichment, let me say to you now: Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you. I'd like to thank NYU for making me technically, on paper at least, a ""doctor."" Not the type of doctor you would want around in case of an emergency, unless your specific emergency was that you desperately needed to hear a song with a catchy hook and an intensely cathartic bridge section. Or if your emergency was that you needed a person who can name over 50 breeds of cats in one minute. I never got to have a ""normal"" college experience, per se. I went to public high school until 10th grade and then finished my education doing homeschool work on the floors of airport terminals. Then, I went on the road for radio tour, which sounds incredibly glamourous, but in reality, it consisted of a rental car, motels, and my mom and I pretending to have loud mother-daughter fights with each other during boarding, so no one would want the empty seat between us on Southwest. As a kid, I always thought I would go away to college, imagining the posters I would hang on the wall of my freshman dorm. I even set the ending of my music video for my song ""Love Story"" at my fantasy, imaginary college, where I meet a male model reading a book on the grass, and with one single glance, we realize we had been in love in our past lives. Which is exactly what you guys all experienced at some point in the last four years, right? But I really can't complain about not having a normal college experience to you, because you went to NYU during a global pandemic, being essentially locked into your dorms and having to do classes over Zoom. Everyone in college during normal times stresses about test scores, but on top of that, you also had to pass, like, a thousand COVID tests. I imagine the idea of a normal college experience was all you wanted, too, but in this case, you and I both learned that you don't always get all the things in the bag that you selected from the menu in the delivery service that is life. You get what you get. And as I would like to say to you, wholeheartedly, you should be very proud of what you've done with it. Today, you leave New York University and then go out into the world, searching what's next. And so will I. So, as a rule, I try not to give anyone unsolicited advice, unless they ask for it. I'll go into this more later. I guess I have been officially solicited in this situation to impart whatever wisdom I might have to tell you things that have helped me so far in my life. Please, bear in mind that I, in no way, feel qualified to tell you what to do. You've worked, and struggled, and sacrificed, and studied, and dreamed your way here today, and so you know what you're doing. You'll do things differently than I did them and for different reasons. So, I won't tell you what to do, 'cause no one likes that. I will, however, give you some life hacks I wish I knew when I was starting out my dreams of a career and navigating life, love, pressure, choices, shame, hope, and friendship. The first of which is: Life can be heavy, especially if you try to carry it all at once. Part of growing up and moving into new chapters of your life is about catch and release. What I mean by that is knowing what things to keep and what things to release. You can't carry all things, all grudges, all updates on your ex, all enviable promotions your school bully got at the hedge fund his uncle started. Decide what is yours to hold and let the rest go. Oftentimes, the good things in your life are lighter anyway, so there's more room for them. One toxic relationship can outweigh so many wonderful simple joys. You get to pick what your life has time and room for. Be discerning. Secondly: Learn to live alongside cringe. No matter how hard you try to avoid being cringe, you will look back on your life and cringe, retrospectively. Cringe is unavoidable over a lifetime, even the term cringe might someday be deemed ""cringe."" I promise you, you're probably doing or wearing something right now that you will look back on later and find revolting and hilarious. You can't avoid it, so don't try to. For example, I had a phase where, for the entirety of 2012, I dressed like a 1950s housewife. But you know what? I was having fun. Trends and phases are fun. Looking back and laughing is fun. And while we're talking about things that make us squirm, but really shouldn't, I'd like to say I'm a big advocate for not hiding your enthusiasm for things. It seems to me that there is a false stigma around eagerness in our culture of unbothered ambivalence. This outlook perpetuates the idea that it's not cool to want it; the people who don't try are fundamentally more chic than people who do. And I wouldn't know, because I am a lot of things, but I've never been expert on chic, but I'm the one who's up here, so you have to listen to me when I say this. Never be ashamed of trying. Effortlessness is a myth. The people who wanted it the least were the ones I wanted to date, and be friends with in high school. The people who want it the most are the people I now hire to work for my company. I started writing songs when I was 12, and since then, it's been the compass guiding my life, and in turn, my life guided my writing. Everything I do is just an extension of my writing, whether it's directing videos, or a short film, creating the visuals for a tour, or standing on a stage performing. Everything is connected by my love of the craft, the thrill of working through ideas, narrowing them down, polishing it up in the end, editing, waking up in the middle of the night, throwing out an old idea because you thought of a newer, better one, or a plot device that ties it all together. There's a reason they call it a hook: Sometimes a string of words just ensnares me and I can't focus on anything until it's been recorded or written down. As a songwriter, I've never been able to sit still or stay in one place for too long. I've made and released 11 albums and, in the process, I've switched genre from country to pop to alternative to folk, and this might sound like a very songwriter centric line of discussion, but in a way, I really do think we are all writers. And most of us write in a different voice for different situations. You write differently in your Instagram stories than you do your senior thesis; you send a different type of email to boss than you do to your best friend from home. We are all literary chameleons and I think it's fascinating — it's a continuation of the idea that we are many things all the time. And I know it can be very overwhelming figuring out who to be and when, who you are now and how to act in order to get where you want to go. I have some good news: It's totally up to you. I have some terrifying news: It's totally up to you. I said to you earlier that I don't ever offer advice unless someone asks for it, and now I'll tell you why. As a person who started my very public career at the age of 15, it came with a price, and that price was years of unsolicited advice. Being the youngest person in every room for over a decade meant that I was constantly being issued warnings from older members of the music industry, media, interviewers, executives. And this advice often presented itself as thinly veiled warnings. See, I was a teenager at a time when our society was absolutely obsessed with the idea of having perfect young female role models. It felt like every interview I did included slight barbs by the interviewer about me one day ""running off the rails,"" and that meant a different thing to every person who said it to me. So, I became a young adult while being fed the message that if I didn't make any mistakes, all the children of America would grow up to be perfect angels. However, if I did slip up, the entire Earth would fall off its axis, and it would be entirely fault, and I would go to pop star jail forever and ever. It was all centered around the idea that mistakes equal failure, and ultimately the loss of any chance at a happy or rewarding life. This has not been my experience. My experience has been that my mistakes led to the best things in my life, and being embarrassed when you mess up is part of the human experience. Getting back up, dusting yourself off, and seeing who still wants to hang out after and laugh about it — that's a gift. The times I was told no, or wasn't included, wasn't chosen, didn't win, didn't make the cut, looking back, it really feels like those moments were as important, if not more crucial than the moments I was told yes. Not being invited to the parties and sleepovers in my hometown made me feel hopelessly lonely, but because I felt alone I would sit in my room and write the songs that would get me a ticket somewhere else. Having label executives in Nashville tell me that only 35-year-old housewives listened to Country music and there was no place for a 13-year-old on their roster made me cry in the car on the way home. But then I'd post my songs on my MySpace — yes, MySpace — and I would message with other teens like me who loved country music, but just didn't have anyone singing from their perspective. Having journalists write in-depth, oftentimes critical, pieces about who they perceived me to be made me feel like I was living in some weird simulation, but it also made me look inward to learn about who I actually am. Having the world treat my love life like a spectator sport in which I lose every single game was not a great way to date in my teens and twenties, but it taught me to protect my private life fiercely. Being publicly humiliated over and over again at a young age was excruciatingly painful, but it forced me to devalue the ridiculous notion of minute-by-minute, ever-fluctuating social relevance and likeability. Getting canceled on the internet and nearly losing my career gave me an excellent knowledge of all the types of wine. I know I sound like a consummate optimist, but I'm really not. I lose perspective all the time. Sometimes, everything just feels completely pointless. I know the pressure of living your life through the lens of perfectionism. And I know that I'm talking to a group of perfectionists because you are here today graduating from NYU. So this might be hard for you to hear: In your life, you will inevitably misspeak, trust the wrong person, underreact, overreact, hurt the people who didn't deserve it, overthink, not think at all, self-sabotage, create a reality where only your experience exists, ruin perfectly good moments for yourself and others, deny any wrongdoing, not take the steps to make it right, feel very guilty, let the guilt eat at you, hit rock bottom, finally address the pain you caused, try to do better next time, rinse, repeat. And I'm not going to lie, these mistakes will cause you to lose things. I'm trying to tell you that losing things doesn't just mean losing. A lot of the time, when we lose things, we gain things too. Now, you leave the structure and framework of school and chart your own path. Every choice you make leads to the next choice, which leads to the next, and I know it's hard to know which path to take. There will be times in life when you need to stand up for yourself. Times when the right thing is actually to back down and apologize. Times when the right thing is to fight. Times when the right thing is to turn and run. Times to hold on with all you have, and times to let go with grace. Sometimes the right thing to do is to throw out the old schools of thought in the name of progress and reform. Sometimes the right thing to do is to sit and listen to wisdom to those who have come before us. How will you know what the right choice is in these crucial moments? You won't. How do I give advice to this many people about their life choices? I won't. The scary news is, you're on your own now. But the cool news is, you're on your own now. I leave you with this: We are led on our gut instincts, our intuition, our desires and fears, our scars, and our dreams. And you will screw it up sometimes. So will I, and when I do, you will most likely read about it on the internet. Anyway, hard things will happen to us, we will recover, we will learn from it, we will grow more resilient because of it, and as long as we are fortunate enough to be breathing, we will breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, and breathe out. And I am a doctor now, so I know how breathing works. I hope you know how proud I am to share this day with you. We're doing this together, so let's just keep dancing like we're the class of '22.2Embed"

10,Taylor Swift,N/A,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30,Elle Magazine,"Lesson 1 I learned to block some of the noise. Social media can be great, but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you aren't, how you're failing, or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment. One thing I do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments. Yes, I keep comments off on my posts. That way, I'm showing my friends and fans updates on my life, but I'm training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that I look 🔥🔥🔥. I'm also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to ""go die in a hole ho"" while I'm having my coffee at nine in the morning. I think it's healthy for your self-esteem to need less internet praise to appease it, especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist. An actual comment I received once. Lesson 2 Being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble. While it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady, this can contribute to some of your life's worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you. Grow a backbone, trust your gut, and know when to strike back. Be like a snake—only bite if someone steps on you. Lesson 3 Trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal. It may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture (you had to give me one moment of bitterness, come on). BUT THAT SAID, it's good to mess up and learn from it and take risks. It's especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching. That's GOOD. We'll always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace. No, this is not an excuse to text your ex right now. That's not what I said. Or do it, whatever, maybe you'll learn from it. Then you'll probably forget what you learned and do it again.... But it's fine; do you, you're searching. Lesson 4 I learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body. I worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair, and more energy. I think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick fix. I work on accepting my body every day. Lesson 5 Banish the drama. You only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it. Be discerning. If someone in your life is hurting you, draining you, or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable, blocking their number isn't cruel. It's just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it. Lesson 6 I've learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us. These messages tell women that we aren't allowed to age. It's an impossible standard to meet, and I've been loving how outspoken Jameela Jamil has been on this subject. Reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women we're supposed to defy gravity, time, and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isn't even remotely required of men. Lesson 7 My biggest fear. After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn't know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe. My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds. Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I've ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things. Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I've witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears. Lesson 8 I learned not to let outside opinions establish the value I place on my own life choices. For too long, the projected opinions of strangers affected how I viewed my relationships. Whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me, or what they thought was ""couples goals"" based on a picture I posted on Instagram. That stuff isn't real. For an approval seeker like me, it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my OWN value system of what I actually want. Lesson 9 I learned how to make some easy cocktails like Pimm's cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds, and Mojitos because…2016. Lesson 10 I've always cooked a LOT, but I found three recipes I know I'll be making at dinner parties for life: Ina Garten's Real Meatballs and Spaghetti (I just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat), Nigella Lawson's Mughlai Chicken, and Jamie Oliver's Chicken Fajitas with Molé Sauce. Getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer. I also learned how to immediately calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in my head. (Which is what I'm pretty sure the internet would call a ""weird flex."") Lesson 11 Recently I discovered Command tape, and I definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if I'd hung things that way all along. This is not an ad. I just really love Command tape. Lesson 12 Apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you. Even if it was unintentional, it's so easy to just apologize and move on. Try not to say ""I'm sorry, but..."" and make excuses for yourself. Learn how to make a sincere apology, and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships. Lesson 13 It's my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim. Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying ""This happened to me."" It's something no one would choose for themselves. We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we don't. Lesson 14 When tragedy strikes someone you know in a way you've never dealt with before, it's okay to say that you don't know what to say. Sometimes just saying you're so sorry is all someone wants to hear. It's okay to not have any helpful advice to give them; you don't have all the answers. However, it's not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour. Your support is all someone needs when they're at their lowest point. Even if you can't really help the situation, it's nice for them to know that you would if you could. Lesson 15 Vitamins make me feel so much better! I take L-theanine, which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety. I also take magnesium for muscle health and energy. Lesson 16 Before you jump in headfirst, maybe, I don't know...get to know someone! All that glitters isn't gold, and first impressions actually aren't everything. It's impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room, but what I know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them (I call it a ""solid first 15""), but the layers of a person you discover in time. Are they honest, self-aware, and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it? Do they show up for you when you need them? Do they still love you after they've seen you broken? Or after they've walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if they're people? These are things a first impression could never convey. Lesson 17 After my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a Sharpie as eyeliner (DO NOT DO IT), I felt like I needed to start being nicer to my skin. I now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after I shower, not just in the winter, but all year round, because, why can't I be soft during all the seasons?! Lesson 18 Realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them. For example, never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me. Even as an adult, I still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at. In my twenties I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone. It's important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them. Lesson 19 Playing mind games is for the chase. In a real relationship or friendship, you're shooting yourself in the foot if you don't tell the other person how you feel, and what could be done to fix it. No one is a mind reader. If someone really loves you, they want you to verbalize how you feel. This is real life, not chess. Lesson 20 Learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships. Something about ""we're in our young twenties!"" hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family. And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe they'll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. It's sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but you'll always keep the memories. Lesson 21 Fashion is all about playful experimentation. If you don't look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe, you're doing it wrong. See: Bleachella. Lesson 22 How to fight fair with the ones you love. Chances are you're not trying to hurt the person you love and they aren't trying to hurt you. If you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from, there's a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who ""won"" the fight. I know a couple who, in the thick of a fight, say ""Hey, same team."" Find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built. They don't give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship. They just give out divorce papers. Lesson 23 I learned that I have friends and fans in my life who don't care if I'm #canceled. They were there in the worst times and they're here now. The fans and their care for me, my well-being, and my music were the ones who pulled me through. The most emotional part of the Reputation Stadium Tour for me was knowing I was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up. I'll never forget the ones who stuck around. Lesson 24 I've had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family. Both of my parents have had cancer, and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again. It's taught me that there are real problems and then there's everything else. My mom's cancer is a real problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs. I give all of my worry, stress, and prayers to real problems now. Lesson 25 I remember people asking me, ""What are you gonna write about if you ever get happy?"" There's a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. I'm really grateful to have learned this isn't true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool. Lesson 26 I make countdowns for things I'm excited about. When I've gone through dark, low times, I've always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app (they're free) and adding things I'm looking forward to. Even if they're not big holidays or anything, it's good to look toward the future. Sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now, and it's good to get some perspective that life will always go on, to better things. Lesson 27 I learned that disarming someone's petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh. In my experience, I've come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously. A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet. The fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than I've ever felt in my life, but I can't tell you how hard I had to keep from laughing every time my 63-foot inflatable cobra named Karyn appeared onstage in front of 60,000 screaming fans. It's the Stadium Tour equivalent of responding to a troll's hateful Instagram comment with ""lol."" It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us, but maybe all I'll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive it, and thrive in spite of it. Lesson 28 I'm finding my voice in terms of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change. Only as someone approaching 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers. Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. I'm going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year. Lesson 29 I learned that your hair can completely change texture. From birth, I had the curliest hair and now it is STRAIGHT. It's the straight hair I wished for every day in junior high. But just as I was coming to terms with loving my curls, they've left me. Please pray for their safe return. Lesson 30 My mom always tells me that when I was a little kid, she never had to punish me for misbehaving because I would punish myself even worse. I'd lock myself in my room and couldn't forgive myself, as a five-year-old. I realized that I do the same thing now when I feel I've made a mistake, whether it's self-imposed exile or silencing myself and isolating. I've come to a realization that I need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice, trusting the wrong person, or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone. Step into the daylight and let it go.1Embed"

81,Taylor Swift,N/A,Bejeweled (Behind The Song),NA,"The song ""Bejeweled"" is a song that I think is really about finding confidence when you feel that it's been taken away, for whatever reason. You know, you're feeling insecure, you're feeling taken for granted. One of the things we love to do at night is we love to go dancing, we love to put on an outfit that makes us feel good, and we love to feel like we're still bejeweled. And I think that there are tiny inflections of me, hyping myself up to return to pop music after spending these glorious years writing folk songs and being in this metaphorical forest that I've created. Which I've loved so much but there, there was like a bit of pumping myself back up to be like, ""You can do it, you're still bejeweled,"" like, ""I'm still bejeweled, question mark?"" Um, we'll see, but that's what the song's about.Embed"

97,Taylor Swift,N/A,Billboard Woman of the Decade Speech,NA,"Absolutely love this one, right? This is sort of a... it's not a short speech, so, just, I don't want this to slip and break, 'cause it's very important to me.  Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor, good evening. I wanna first thank Billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor, for -  Whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent, okay. I wanna say thank you so much to Billboard for giving me this honor, for naming me as their Woman of the Decade. So, what does it mean to be the Woman of this Decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. When this decade began, I was 20 years old, and I had put out my self-titled debut album when I was 16. And then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless, and I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs ""Love Story"" and ""You Belong With Me"" to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you. Whether you deserve to be there. Whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success. Or whether it was a savvy record label; it wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror for my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did.  Huh, I'll take it, thanks! Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems, and the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like ""Mean,"" ""Shake It Off,"" and ""Blank Space."" Basically, if people had something to say about me, I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When Fearless did win Album of the Year at the Grammys, and I did become the youngest solo artist to ever win the award, with that win, came criticism and backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young, new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room. At that time, I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was ""A Swift Backlash,"" which is clever, you gotta give it to them. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news, comes some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then. So then, I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now, and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that, soon enough, people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right, and then the circle would keep going on and on, and rolling along, and I would keep accommodating, over-correcting, in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my twenties? Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single... for years. Now they're saying my album Red is filled with too many break-up songs? Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York, and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music? Alright, okay, here's an entire genre shift, and a pop album called 1989.  Oh, you heard it? Sick! Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that, too. Now I'm actually a calculated, manipulator rather than a smart businesswoman? Okay, I'll disappear from public view... for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you? Okay, here's an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last ten years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized, and measured up to each other, and picked at for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or, have you ever heard someone say, about a male artist, ""I really like his songs, but I don't know what it is, there's just something about him I don't like. No! That criticism is reserved for us. But, you know, I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this: who lets that scrutiny break them, and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthly criticized -  Yes! Yeah, thank you. We have similar tastes, I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career, and then slowly but surely, she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner in music. And this year, her incredible album is nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys, because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us. That the only way forward, is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry, whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo, Rosalía, Tayla Parx, Hayley Kiyoko, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Thee Stallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nesbitt, Sigrid, Normani, H.E.R., Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dua Lipa, Ella Mai, Billie Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales, and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast, we have to work this hard, we have to prove that we deserve this, and we have to top our last achievements. Women in music, onstage, or behind the scenes, are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible-feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge, and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could've crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios, behind the mixing board, in A&R meetings, because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room.  We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade, and that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand-in-hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome, like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators, and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade, we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you?  Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up: And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in, and buying up our music, as if it is real estate. As if it's an app, or a shoe line. This just happened to me without my approval, consultation, or consent. After I was denied the chance to purchase my music outright, my entire catalogue was sold to Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings in a deal that I'm told was funded by the Soros family, 23 Capital and the Carlyle Group. Yet, to this day, none of these investors have ever bothered to contact me or my team directly, to perform their due diligence on their investment, on their investment in me, to ask how I might feel about the new owner of my art. The music I wrote, the videos I created, photos of me, my handwriting, my album designs. And of course, Scooter never contacted me or my team to discuss it prior to the sale, or even when it was announced. I'm fairly certain he knew how I would feel about it, though, and let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying, ""But he's always been nice to me!"" when I'm raising valid concerns about artists and their right to own their music. And of course he's nice to you. If you're in this room, you have something he needs. The fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think, according to his own social media post, that he could ""buy me,"" but I'm obviously not going willingly. Yet, the most amazing thing was to discover that it would be the women in our industry who would have my back and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times, and I will never, ever forget it. Like, ever.  But to conclude, I will say that in ten years, I've seen forward steps in our industry. In our awareness, our inclusion, our ability to start calling out unfairness and misconduct. I've seen the advent of social media, the way it can boost the breakthrough of emerging artists. And I've seen fans become more engaged and supportive than ever before. I've leaned on that support, and it has kept me in a place where, no matter what, I always wanted to keep making music for them. I was up on a stage in New York City in 2014, accepting Billboard Woman of the Year, and I was talking about the future of streaming. How we needed to make sure that the female artists, writers, and producers of the next generation were protected and compensated fairly. This was before my record deal with Universal, last year, that would contractually guarantee that the artists on their roster be paid upon any sale of their Spotify shares, unrecupable. So, thank you for that.  This speech I'm referring to was on my 25th birthday. I'm about to turn thirty tonight, woo! But my exact quote during this speech was, ""I really just feel like we need to continue to try to offer something to a younger generation of musicians. Because somewhere, right now, your future Woman of the Year is probably sitting in a piano lesson, or in a girls' choir. And today, right now, we need to take care of her."" I've since learned that, at that exact moment, an 11-year old girl in California really was taking piano lessons, and really was in a girls' choir. And this year, she has been named Woman of the Year at the age of seventeen. Her name is Billie.  And those are the stories we need to think about every day as we do our jobs in this industry. The ones where people's dreams come true and they get to create music and play it for people. The ones where fans feel a connection to music that makes their day easier, makes their night more fun, makes their love feel more sacred, or their heartache feel less isolating. The ones where all of you in this room stand as an example for someone else in the next generation who loves the same thing that we love: music. And no matter what else enters the conversation, we will bring it back to music. And as for me, lately I've been focusing less on doing what they say I can't do and more on doing whatever the hell I want. Thank you for a magnificent, happy, free, confused, sometimes lonely, but mostly golden decade. I'm honored to be here tonight, I feel very lucky to be with you, thank you so much.2Embed"

139,Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift (Big Machine Radio Release Special),Cold As You - Commentary,NA,"Taylor Swift: I tried to write my biography not, you know, as somebody else was writing it. You know, a lot of artists have, ""So-and-so is the best, you know, musician ever,"" and I just didn't wanna have my biography be like that, so I decided to write mine in first person. Telling about who I am as a person, what I like, what I don't like, what annoys me, what I love, you know, stuff like that. 'Cause I always wanted my favorite artists to do that. I always thought it would've been cool if the Country artists that I looked up to when I was little would've given the fans something really cool. So I thought it was pretty cool to give these people information about me, 'cause I'm not scared of it. Becca: Well, it was that willingness to not be scared and to share herself with her fans that have endeared her to them for so long and, of course, the songs have also connected Taylor to her fans forever. I know this song has helped a lot of people find their way out of bad situations. This is ""Cold As You,"" Taylor Swift, on Big Machine Radio.Embed"

Were you standing in the hallway With a big cake, happy birthday Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?

193,Taylor Swift,evermore (deluxe version),Evermore [Liner Notes],NA,"To put it plainly, we just couldn't stop writing songs. To try and put it more poetically, it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice: to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music. We chose to wander deeper in and my collaborators and I are proud to announce that my 9th studio album and folklore's sister record is here. It's called evermore. I've never done this before. In the past I've always treated albums as onе-off eras and moved onto planning the nеxt one as soon as an album was released. There was something different with folklore. In making it, I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning. I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales. I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found. So I just kept writing them. And I loved creating these songs with Aaron Dessner, Jack Antonoff, WB, and Justin Vernon. We've also welcomed some new (and longtime) friends to our musical kitchen table this time around... Before I knew it there were 17 tales, some of which are mirrored or intersecting with one another. The one about two young con artists who fall in love while hanging out at fancy resorts trying to score rich romantic beneficiaries. The one where longtime college sweethearts had very different plans for the same night, one to end it and one who brought a ring. Dorothea, the girl who left her small town to chase down Hollywood dreams - and what happens when she comes back for the holidays and rediscovers an old flame. The 'unhappily ever after' anthology of marriages gone bad that includes infidelity, ambivalent toleration, and even murder. The most righteous motive, to avenge the fallen. The realization that maybe the only path to healing is to wish happiness on the one who took it away from you. One starring my grandmother, Marjorie, who still visits me sometimes...if only in my dreams. I wanted to surprise you with this the week of my 31st birthday. You've all been so caring, supportive and thoughtful on my birthdays and so this time I wanted to give you something! I also know this holiday season will be a lonely one for most of us and of there are any of you out there who turn to music to cope with missing loved ones the way I do, this is for you. I have no idea what will come next. I have no idea about a lot of things these days and so I've clung to the one thing that keeps me connected to you all. That thing always has and always will be music. And may it continue, evermore. 1Embed"

207,Taylor Swift,N/A,Fearless (Platinum Edition) [Liner Notes],NA,"First and foremost, thank you for buying the Fearless Platinum Edition. When I put out Fearless, I had high hopes and no expectations. A short time later, I sit here, trying to think of words that might fully express to you how thankful I am. On this new version of Fearless, you will find 6 new songs. They're songs about falling for someone who is so desperately out of reach, daydreaming about a superstar, jumping then falling into the most beautiful summer love imaginable, then trying not to go back in your mind to evеry laugh and everything you miss. Thesе are songs about how the stars twinkle a little brighter when you love someone, and how many fights could be resolved if they would just stand outside your window, throwing pebbles, screaming ""I'm in love with you!"" In my mind, these things are fearless. I'm crossing my fingers, hoping you will agree. :) I love you, forever and always. Fearlessly, TaylorEmbed"

209,Taylor Swift,N/A,Fearless (Taylor's Version) [Announcement & Liner Notes],NA,"fearless was an album full of magic and curiosity, the bliss and devastation of youth. it was the diaRy of the adventures and explorations of a teenage girl who was learning tiny lessons with every new crack in the facade of the faIrytale ending she'd been shown in the movies. i'm thrilled to tell you that my new version of fearless is done and will be with you soon it's called fearless (taylor's version) and it includes 26 songs. i've spoken a lot about why i'm remaking my first six albums, but the way i've chosen to do this will hopefuLy help illuminate where i'm coming from. artists should own their own work for so many reasons, but the most screamingly obvious one is that the artist is the only one who really *knows* that body of work. for example, only i know which songs i wrote that almost made the fearless album. songs i absolutely adored, but were held back for different reasons (don't want too many breakup songs, don't want too maNy down tempo songs, can't fit that many songs on a physical cd). those reasons seem unnecessary now. i've decIded i want you to have the whole story, see the entire vivid picture and let you into the entire dreamscape that is my fearless album. that's why i've chosen to include 6 never before released songs on my version of this album. written when i was betweeN the ages 16 and 18, these were the ones it killed me to leave behind. this process has been more fulfilling and emoTional than i could've imagined and has made me even more determined to re-recorded all of my music. i Hope you'll like this first outing as much as i liked traveling back in time to recreate it. love story (taylor's version) will be out tonight. sincerely and fearlessly, taylor1Embed"

218,Taylor Swift,folklore (deluxe version),​folklore [Foreword],NA,"Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of ""let's run away"" and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate. Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I've never met, people I've known, or those I wish I hadn't. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isn't his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong. An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession. A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize. Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line. My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942. A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out. A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someone's secrets written in the sky for all to behold. In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. I've told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve. Now it's up to you to pass them down.Embed"
219,Taylor Swift,N/A,Folklore Interlude (Wildest Dreams x Seven),NA,"If you wish to romanticize the woman I became Then say you'll remember me Standin' in a nice dress Starin' at the sunset Or you could begin at the beginning And in that case  Please picture me in the trees I hit my peak at seven, Feet in the swing over the creek I was too scared to jump in But I was high in the sky Pennsylvania under me Are there still beautiful things? Sweet tea in the summer Cross your heart, won't tell no other And though I can't recall your face I still got love for you Your braids make a pattern Love you to the Moon and to Saturn Passed down like folk songs The love lasts so longEmbed"
220,Taylor Swift,Speak Now (Taylor’s Version),Foolish One (Taylor's Version) [From The Vault],Taylor Swift & Aaron Dessner,"My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right And I will block out these voices of reason in my head  And the voices say, ""You are not the exception You will never learn your lesson""  Foolish one Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love That ain't never gonna come You will take the long way, you will take the long way down  You know how to keep me waitin' I know how to act like I'm fine Don't know what to call this situation But I know I can't call you mine And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof 'Cause when my head is on your shoulder It starts thinkin' you'll come around And maybe, someday, when we're older This is something we'll laugh about Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news You might also like But then the voices say, ""You are not the exception You will never learn your lesson""  Foolish one Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love That ain't never gonna come You will take the long way, you will take the long way down Foolish one Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love That ain't never gonna come You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out  Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands Sayin', ""How could I not see the signs?"" Oh, you haven't written me or called But goodbye screamin' in the silence And the voices in my head are tellin' me why 'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring And you will say you had the best of intentions And maybe I will finally learn my lesson  Foolish one Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love That ain't never gonna come You will take the long way, you will take the long way down Foolish one Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love That ain't never gonna come You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh La-la-la-la-la Ain't never gonna come Ooh, you will learn the hard way now Foolish one Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love They ain't never gonna come And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out Foolish one The day is gonna come for your confessions of love When all is said and done, he just wasn't the one No, he just wasn't the one7Embed"

239,Taylor Swift,N/A,"""Happy Voting! 🗳😃🌈""",NA,"I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway. So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info. Happy Voting! 🗳😃🌈1Embed"

I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that you've been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain and just, one day, you wake up and you realize you're indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. And so this is a clip of me just trying to tinkering around on the piano, trying to figure out exactly what I wanted to do with it, and you can hear the end result on the album, but this is where it started  I forgot that you existed Thought I'd miss you but I didn't And it was so nice (Humming) I forgot that you existed I forgot that you existed Thought I'd miss you but I didn't And it was so nice I forgot that you existed How I'd miss you but I didn't And it was so nice So peaceful and How many nights I, how you did me How many days did I wait thinking 'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?

271,Taylor Swift,reputation,If You're Anything Like Me [Poem],NA,"You bite your nails, And laugh when you're nervous. You promise people the world, because that's what they want from you. You like giving them what they want... But darling, you need to stop, If you're anything like me, You knock on wood every time you make plans. You cross your fingers, hold your breath, Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck. Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado... If life gets too good now, Darling, it scares you. If you're anything like me, You never wanted to lock your door, Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore For fear she was much better before... But Darling, now you have to. If you're anything like me, There's a justice system in your head For names you'll never speak again, And you make your ruthless rulings. Each new enemy turns to steel They become the bars that confine you, In your own little golden prison cell... But Darling, there is where you meet yourself. If you're anything like me You've grown to hate your pride To love your thighs And no amount of friends at 25 Will fill the empty seats At the lunch tables of your past The teams that picked you last... But Darling, you keep trying. If you're anything like me, You couldn't recognize the face of your love Until they stripped you of your shiny paint Threw your victory flag away And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway... Darling, later on you will thank your stars for that frightful day. If you're anything like me, I'm sorry. But Darling, it's going to be okay.24Embed"

It can spiral downward and it can spiral way up, and you can be really feeling yourself, and ""Karma"" is written from a perspective of feeling really happy, really proud of the way your life is, feeling like this must be a reward for going stuff right. It's a song that I really love because I think wе all need some of those moments, you know, wе can't just be beating ourselves up all the time.

345,Taylor Swift,N/A,Lover [Foreword],NA,"But what shocked me the most was how often I wrote down the things I loved. Writing a new song, riding in the car with my mom, the purple-pink skies of the soccer field  on the walk home, the one night in middle school when none of my friends were fighting, the dazzle of opal necklaces I couldn’t afford gleaming from a department store jewelry case. I wrote about tiny details in my life in these diaries from a bygone age with such... wonderment. Intrigue. Romance. I noticed things and decided they were romantic, and so they were. In life, we grow up and we encounter the nuanced complexities of trying to figure out who to be, how to act, or how to be happy. Like invisible smoke in the room, we wonder what kind of anxiety pushes you forward and what kind ruins your ability to find joy in your life. We constantly question our choices, our surroundings, and we beat ourselves up for our mistakes. All the while, we crave romance. We long for those rare, enchanting moments when things just fall into place. Above all else, we really, really want our lives to be filled with love. I've decided that in this life, I want to be defined by the things I love- not the things I hate, the things I'm afraid of, or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night. Those things may be struggles, but they're not my identity. I wish the same for you. May your struggles become inaudible background noise behind the loud, clear voices of those who love and appreciate you. Turn those voices up in the mix in your head. May you take notice of the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even find wonderment in them. May you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later, only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might kill you... didn't. I hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed. I hope that if there is a lover in your life, it's someone who deserves you. If that's the case, I hope you treat them with care. This album is a love letter to love itself- all the captivating, spellbinding, maddening devastating red, blue, gray, golden aspects of it (that's why there are so many songs). In honor of fever dreams, bad boys, confessions of love on a drunken night out, Christmas lights still hanging in January, guitar string scars on my hands, false gods and blind faith, memories of jumping into an icy outdoor pool, creaks in floorboards and ultraviolet morning light, finally finding a friend, and opening the curtains to see the clearest, brightest daylight after the darkest night. We are what we love. This is Lover.Embed"

348,Taylor Swift,Lover (Target Exclusive/Japanese Edition),Lover (Piano/Vocal),Taylor Swift,"Writing the song ""Lover"" was one of those magical experiences that you sometimes get to have as a songwriter. Um, I wrote it really quick in the middle of the night. As soon as I wrote it, I knew I wanted it to be the album title. And I knew that writing it kinda would depict the tone of the entire record. So it was a real catalyst for what this album turned into. And I wrote it alone, so I wanted to go in and play it for Jack Antonoff who I knew who would be the perfect person to produce it. And so I walked into the studio and I sat in the piano. And this is what happened So it is, it's basically, I don't see it as a piano. I think it's that like, kinda of, dreamy, guitary, throwback, but not like camp throwback, so.  We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January This is our place, we make the rules And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?  Can I go where you go? Can we always be this close forever and ever? And ah, take me out, take me home You're my, my, my, my lover  Yeah, I love the walk down. I love the walk down. I was trying to figure out ""what the hell is gonna happen there"" So the, so.  My, my, my, my lover  We could let our friends crash on the couches This is our place, we make the call And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all Can I go where you go? Can we always be this close forever and ever? And ah, take me out, and take me home You're my, my, my, my lover  Okay and then I have this bridge thing that's um, essentially, Well, no I was, I did, I did it in this key, but it could be like a thing where it's like a key change. So it plays off of the walk down-ish. But it's, this is the melody of it, it goes, it's like  Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand? With every guitar string scar on my hands I take this magnetic force- Oh, **** I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue All's well that ends well to end up with you Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me  Wait, so goes...  And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me And at every table, I'll save you a seat So goes, and you, it goes...  And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me My heart's been borrowed your heart's been blue All's well that ends well to end up with you Swear to be overdramatic Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me And at every table, I'll save you a seat  You like? Yeah! I've never, I never do these cords, but, I was really at the piano, like, hashing it out yesterday.1Embed"

391,Taylor Swift,N/A,Midnights [Liner Notes],NA,"It's a momentary glimmer of distraction. The tiniest notion of reminiscent thought that wanders off into wondering, the spark that lights a tinderbox of fixation. And now it is irreversible. The flame has caught. You're wide awake. Maybe it's that one urgent question you meant to ask someone years ago but didn't. Someone that slipped through the cracks in your history, and they're too far gone now anyway. All the ghost ships that have sailed and sailed away, but at this hour, they've anchored in your harbor. They sit with flags waving, bright and beautiful. And it's almost likе it's real. Sometimes sleep is as еvasive as happiness. Isn't it mystifying how quickly we vacillate between self love and loathing at this hour? One moment, your life looks like a night sky of gleaming stars. The next, the fog has descended. Suddenly you're in the town you left behind all those years ago. The trees of your youth with the phantom memory echoes of your belly laughter, and the rope indentations of your old tire swing still on the branch. All the phone numbers you still know by heart but never call anymore. The boy's devastated face as he peeled out of your driveway. The family man he is now. What must they all think of you. Why can't you sleep? Maybe you lie awake in the aftershock of falling headlong into a connection that feels like some surreal cataclysmic event. Like spontaneous combustion, or seeing snow falling on a tropical beach. A lavender haze crush that feels like the crash of a wave. Or was tonight the night you realized how solitary, how alone you really are, no matter how high you climb. The elevation just makes it colder. Some midnights, you're out and you're buzzing with electric current — an adventurer in pursuit of rapturous thrill. Music blaring from speakers and the reckless intimacy of dancing with strangers. Something in this shadowy room to make you feel shiny again. On these nights, you know that there are facets of you that only glow in the dark. Why are you still up at this hour? Because you're cosplaying vengeance fantasies, where the bad bad man is hauled away in handcuffs and you get to watch it happen. You laugh into the mirror with a red wine snarl. You look positively deranged. Maybe you were trying to mastermind matters of the heart again. You've gotten lost in the labyrinth of your head, where the fear wraps its claws around the fragile throat of true love. Will you be able to save it in time? Save it from who? Well, it's obvious. From you. We lie in love and in fear and in turmoil and in tears. We stare at walls and drink until they speak back. We twist in our self-made cages and pray that we aren't — right this minute — about to make some fateful life-altering mistake. This is a collection of music written in the middle of the night, a journey through terrors and sweet dreams. The floors we pace and the demons we face. For all of us who have tossed and turned and decided to keep the lanterns lit and go searching. Hoping that just maybe, when the clock strikes twelve...we'll meet ourselves. See you there. Midnight sharp. TaylorEmbed"

416,Taylor Swift,N/A,NMPA Songwriter Icon Award Speech,NA,"First of all, to anyone who wrote with me in Nashville when I was in eighth or ninth grade: That is insane that you did that, and I am so lucky that I got to learn from some of the best writers on Music Row. Liz Rose was someone who spent hours and hours and hours with me when there was absolutely no sign that anything would happen in my career. My dance card was not full, I was 14, and she wrote with me so many times and taught me how to edit my ideas down into something that would pack an emotional punch. Then, later in my career, I got to work with Max Martin and Johan Shellback, who I learned so much from  a melodic sense, and I will carry those lessons with me for the rest of my life. I will learn more lessons from them next time we work together, and I feel really lucky that they’ve been a part of my life. Jack Antonoff is such a wonderful creator and such a nurturing presence — with his own art and other artists, he’s just so versatile and such a wonderful friend. Aaron Dessner came into my life recently, and he is just such a prolific creator. All of these people changed my writing and helped shape it. There are so many others, though. So if you’ve ever sat in a room and cowritten with me, thank you so much. Anyone who’s ever wanted to produce one of my songs, any collaborator I’ve ever had — I’ve learned from all of you. I want to say thank you to Troy Tomlinson for always being excited to hear new songs of mine, and to Jody Gerson for being such a champion of female songwriters throughout the industry. This is something I am so proud to receive. And to the fans who are out there who care about my lyrics — you have no idea how much it means to me that you dissect them and copy them into your journals and care about the words that I write. There are amazing songwriters who came before me who deserve this, there are incredible songwriters coming up now who are so impressive and amazing: I have such an affinity and respect for all of you. I am honored to receive this. Thank you so much.Embed"

450,Taylor Swift,Woman Walk The Line ,Rare Peer (Brenda Lee Tribute),NA,"""Now I'm gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand. Her voice is full like solid gold, with some platinum blended in. Sometimes you'll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes... but gold is Brenda's metal in this song I wish I'd wrote. Ladies and gentlemen... Brenda Lee."" The camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties. The music starts, and she's looking down at a framed picture. She's at ease. She is theatrical. And she is beautiful, in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye. Lights, camera, action. She starts to sing. That's when you hear the gold, and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand. The performance ends, and the crowd goes wild. The lovely lady graciously takes a bow. She smiles out into the vast darkness, taking it all in with grace and composure. The video ends, and I reflect back on what I just saw. It was a timeless performance, but here are the facts: The year is 1983. The song is ""Someone Loves You Honey."" The man in the tuxedo is Johnny Cash. And the woman in the beautiful dress with the honey-like voice is none other than Brenda Lee. Brenda Lee, who was born in 1944 near Atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father. Brenda Lee, the little girl who took over the music world with chart-topping hits when she was still a child. Brenda Lee, the woman who ushered in a new style of rock & roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television. Brenda Lee, the artist who later went back to her country roots, proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under. Brenda Lee, the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her. I watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause. There's a reason she's been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years. Brenda Lee is grace. Brenda Lee is class and composure. And when she hears the roar of a crowd, Brenda Lee smiles like she's five years old and receiving her first standing ovation. Brenda Lee is someone I will always look up to because of the way she shines. As Johnny Cash said in 1983, it's almost like she's golden.Embed"

454,Taylor Swift,N/A,Red [Liner Notes],NA,"My experiences in love have taught me difficult lessons, especially my experiences with crazy love. The red relationships. The ones that went from zero to a hundred miles per hour and then hit a wall and exploded. And it was awful. And ridiculous. And desperate. And thrilling. And when the dust settled, it was something I’d never take back. Because there is something to be said for being young and needing someone so badly, you jump in head first without looking. And there's something to be learned from waiting all day for a train that's never coming. And there's something to be proud of about moving on and realizing that real love shines golden like starlight, and doesn't fade or spontaneously combust. Maybe I’ll write a whole album about that kind of love if I ever find it. but this album is about the other kinds of love that I’ve recently fallen in and out of. Love that was treacherous, sad, beautiful, and tragic. But most of all, this record is about love that was red.1. State Of Grace Hidden message: I love you doesn't count after goodbye 2.

457,Taylor Swift,N/A,Red (Taylor's Version) [Liner Notes],NA,"I’ve always said that the world is a different place for the heartbroken. It moves on a different axis, at a different speed. Time skips backwards and forwards fleetingly. The heartbroken might go through thousands of micro-emotions a day trying to figure out how to get through it without picking up the phone to hear that old familiar voice. In the land of heartbroken, moments of strength, independence, and devil-may-care rebellion are intricately woven togethеr with grief, paralyzing vulnerability and hopelеssness. Imagining your future might always take you on a detour back to the past. And this is all to say, that this is my version of Red. Musically and lyrically, Red resembled a heartbroken person. It was all over the place, a fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end. Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild, and tortured by memories past. Like trying on pieces of a new life, I went into the studio and experimented with different sounds and collaborators. And I'm not sure if it was pouring my thoughts into this album, hearing thousands of your voices sing the lyrics back to me in passionate solidarity, or if it was simply time, but something was healed along the way. Sometimes you need to talk it over (over and over and over) for it to ever really be... over. Like your friend who calls you in the middle of the night going on and on about their ex, I just couldn't stop writing. This will be the first time you hear all 30 songs that were meant to go on Red. And hey, one of them is even ten minutes long. Sincerely, TaylorEmbed"

461,Taylor Swift,reputation,Reputation [Prologue],NA,"We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip. This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you. The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'. When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right? Let me say it again, louder for those in the back... We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us. There will be no further explanation There will be just reputation.15Embed"
462,Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift ,Reputation Tour Book Intro,NA,"To the times I learned, by watching you sing along to every song, that my greatest triumph in life has been finding the ones who like me for me. And that even in your worst times, they can see the best in you. Here's to the musical family I get to share the stage with and all the things they've sacrificed in their lives to be able to sing, play, and dance as well as they do. Here's to our extraordinary crew and the days they spend away from the ones they love so that we can stand under the lights and play for you. Here's to the people who work at these stadiums and help clean up the glitter on the floor after the party. Here's to getting smarter and harder in the nick of time, but still remaining delicate enough to care deeply for the ones you can trust, and brave enough to stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes. Here's to life teaching us lessons, and us learning, growing, dancing, and changing together. Everything I've learned about a ""reputation"" and how little it really means when defined by those who do not know you, I've learned from the fans whose spirits lit up these stadiums. Thanks to you, I'm doing better than I ever was. Love, Taylor2Embed"

488,Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift (Big Machine Radio Release Special),Should've Said No - Commentary,NA,"Taylor Swift: There are girls in Nashville who are gorgeous and they have amazing voices and wanted to do the same thing that I wanted to do, and I figured out a way to stand out. And, for me, I went back home and I started playing guitar and writing my own music and, in that sense, I could walk into a room and play my own instrument and I could play songs that I've written and, that way, I wouldn't have to depend on anybody creatively. Becca: Taylor Swift has certainly embraced that creative freedom with a vengeance and she has gone on to just make some absolutely incredible music. But today, we are celebrating the beginning, the songs that captivated people when they were so young and have led them to become lifelong Taylor fans. And I know a lot of us have sung along to this one at the top of our lungs, feel free to go ahead and do it again. This is ""Should've Said No"" from Taylor Swift on Big Machine Radio.Embed"

510,Taylor Swift,N/A,Speak Now [Liner Notes],NA,"'Speak now or forever hold your peace,' the words said by preachers at the end of wedding ceremonies all over the world, right before the vows. It's a last chance for protest, a moment that makes everyone's heart race, and a moment I've always been strangely fascinated by. So many fantasize about bursting into a church, saying what they'd kept inside for years like in the movies. In real life, it rarely happens. Real life is a funny thing, you know. In real life, saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial. So crucial, in fact, the most of us start to hesitate, for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. But lately what I've begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything. I think most of us fear reaching the end of our life, and looking back regretting the moments we didn't speak up. When we didn't say 'I love you.' When we should've said 'I'm sorry.' When we didn't stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help. These songs are made up of words I didn’t say when the moment was right in front of me. These songs are open letters. Each is written with a specific person in mind, telling them what I meant to tell them in person. To the beautiful boy whose heart I broke in December. To my first love who I never thought would be my first heartbreak. To my band. To a mean man I used to be afraid of. To someone who made my world very dark for a while. To a girl who stole something of mine. To someone I forgive for what he said in front of the whole world. Words can break someone into a million pieces, but they can also put them back together. I hope you use yours for good, because the only words you’ll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone. What you say might be too much for some people. Maybe it will come out all wrong and you’ll stutter and you’ll walk away embarrassed, wincing as you play it all back in your head. But I think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest. So say it to them. Or say it to yourself in the mirror. Say it in a letter you’ll never send or in a book millions might read someday. I think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying ‘I could’ve, but it’s too late now.’ There is a time for silence. There is a time waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you’ll know it. I don't think you should wait. I think you should speak now.

513,Taylor Swift,Speak Now (Taylor’s Version),Speak Now (Taylor's Version) [Prologue],NA,"I think they might just be the most idealistic, hopеful years too. At this point in my life, I had relеased my second album, Fearless, it became the breakthrough moment I'd always dreamt of, one that catapulted my career to new realms of success. It had brought with it tidal wave of premises and pitfalls and growing pains. All the while, I was encountering the milestones and checkpoints of normal teenage growth. I had cataclysmic crushes and brushes with heartache, I moved out of my parents' house and set my bags down in a new apartment, I hung photos on my walls and decorated the space where I would sob and cackle and chatter and dream. Sometimes I feel like a grown up, but a lot of the time I just wanted to time travel back to my childhood bed, where my mom would read stories to me until I fell asleep. In my darker moments, I was tormented by the doubt that swirled loudly around my ascent and my merits as an artist. I was trying to create a follow up to the most awarded country album in history, while staring directly into the face of intense criticism. I had been widely and publicly slammed for my singing voice and was first encountering the infuriating question that is unfortunately still lobbed at me to this day: does she really write her songs? Spoiler alert: I really, really do. In the years since, I've developed a thicker skin about public criticism and the cynicism with which some people approach the music I make. At that time, it leveled me. I had these voices in my head telling me that I had the perfect chance and I blew it. I hadn't been good enough, I had given it all and been found wanting. I wanted to get better, to challenge myself, and to build on my skills as a writer, an artist, and a performer. I didn't want to just be handed respect and acceptance in my field, I wanted to earn it. To try and confront these demons, I underwent extensive vocal training and made a decision that would completely define the album: I decided I would write it entirely on my own. I figured, they couldn't give all the credit to my cowriters if there weren't any. But that posed a new challenge: It really had to be good. If it wasn't, it would be proving my critics right. I had no idea how much this pain would change me. That this was the beginning of my series of creative choices made by reacting to setbacks with defiance. That my stubbornness in the face of doubters and dissenters would become my coping mechanism through my entire career from that point forward. This exact pattern of enacting my own form of rebellion when I feel broken is exactly why you're reading these very words, and I'm re-releasing this album now. I went through my first worldwide scandal (the mic-grab seen around the world). I experienced the weirdness of trying to get to know a boy while a swarm of paparazzi surrounds the car. Media contacting my publicist for an official statement on why two teenagers broke up. These are weird experiences to have at any age, but even more surreal when you're 19. I had the nagging sense that in the most intense moments of my life, I had frozen. I had said nothing publicly, I still don't know if it was an instinct, not wanting to seem impolite, or just ofmverwhelming fear. But I made sure to say it all in these songs. I decided to call the album Speak Now. It was a play on the ""speak now or forever hold your peace"" moment in weddings, but for me it symbolized a chance to respond to the chatter and commentary around my own life. Some of these emotional revelations were surprising to people. Some expected anger and instead got compassion and empathy with ""Innocent."" Some expected a kiss of breakup song but instead got a hand-on-heart apology, ""Back to December."" It was an album that was the most precious to me because of its vast extremes. It was unfiltered and potent. In my mind, the saddest song I've ever written is ""Last Kiss."" My most scathing is ""Dear John"" and my most wistfully romantic is ""Enchanted."" I'll be forever proud of setting a goal and seeing it through. I'll always feel shivers all over when I remember singing ""Long Live"" to close the show every night on tour. The outstretched hands of those bright and beautiful faces of the fans. Their support was like an open palm that reached out and helped me up off the ground when others were, frankly, mean. These days I make my choices for those people who thought I had been good enough all along. I try to speak my mind when I feel strongly in the moment I feel it. I'm still idealistic and earnest about the music I make, but I'm less crushed when people mock me for it. I know now that one of the bravest things a person can do is create something with unblinking sincerity, to put it all on the line. I still sometimes wish I was a little kid again in a tiny bed before I ever grew up. I always looked at this album as my album, and the lump in my throat expands to a quivering voice as I say this. Thanks to you, dear reader, it finally will be. I consider this music to be, along with your faith in me, the best thing that's ever been mine. Yours, TaylorEmbed"

524,Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift (Big Machine Radio Release Special),Stay Beautiful - Commentary,NA,"Taylor Swift: My advice to first-time songwriters would be, you know, the person you're writing the song about, first know that, and then write a letter to them, like, what you would say if you could, 'cause that's why I listen to music, it's because it says how I feel better than I could and it says what I wish I'd said when that moment was there. So, I would say, be as direct as you possibly can. If you needed to rewrite it back later, I guess do that, but, for me, I think the more details, the better. The more it seems like a journal entry, the better. The more it seems like an open letter, the better. The more true and honest and real it gets, where you're naming the places you were, the times it happened, all the things about a relationship. If you can, in your songwriting, be as detailed as possible, because, for people to relate to it, they may not have the same details in their relationship that you had in yours, but they can relate in that they had these little details to their relationship, too Becca: In fact, I know a lot of people connected to the details of this next song that we're about to play off Taylor Swift's debut album. This is ""Stay Beautiful"" on Big Machine Radio.Embed"

548,Taylor Swift,N/A,Taylor Swift Responds To Kanye's 'Famous' Lyric,NA,"Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song? It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009.You might also like2Embed"

550,Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift (Deluxe),Taylor Swift's First Phone Call With Tim McGraw (Ft. Tim McGraw),NA,"Hey a little bit ago we were talking about uh, songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song, and um, up next in the countdown is Taylor Swift, and have you heard this song yet?  I have heard this song  Tim McGraw. And what what did you think the first time you heard it? Or how was the first time?  It was awesome. Uh, except for, I didn't know if I should, I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old?  Ah, ha ha ha  I didn't know which one but the more, the more I hear it the more, I don't know if its true or not, but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I'm old, I don't know if that's true, but that's what I choose to think.  Why don't we find out. Taylor is a compliment, or uh, he's old?  Oh its definitely a compliment. Yeah. (Laughing)  Tim McGraw, meet Taylor Swift. Nice-  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?  I'm doing great. How are you doing?  I'm doing good. Congratulations on your record. It's doing great.  Thank you so much. I'm just so excited. Thank you for, uh, having good... music and everything. I swear I'm not a stalker (Laughing)  Well-  The funny thing about this song is ya know, as a writer, some of the songs that you write like four hours, you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes. And ya know, I really didn't think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so I kinda shelved it for like three months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. But, um, my label heard it and was like, ""we're putting that out.""(Laughing)  Well, I'm glad ya did, 'cause, um, it's doing well for ya. So I-, so I understand that you two guys have not talked.  No.  You haven't met.  No.  No, we've never talked or met or anything.  I sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly Or something like that. Oh, I don't remember what show it was. I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message, so, I don't know if she got it or not.  Oh my God. They never gave that to me.  They didn't? Okay, well, there ya go. I did. (Laughing)  So I-I. We've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything.  Not at all.  So I thought, I think it's pretty brave to put out a song called Tim McGraw without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?  It was definitely kind of a chance. Ya know, I didn't say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking, ya know, he wouldn't take it too bad.  Well, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad I'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. Tell me-  Could you tell Faith that I said hello?  I sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way.  Oh my gosh, she's awesome.  I agree.  This, this...Tell me about writing a song. Um, did this, did this really happen?  Well, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing Session on I'm gonna write a song called Tim McGraw Um, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um... (Laughing). I actually this this is kinda strange, but I actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school.  Now I feel old.  And um, I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself. And I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up. So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. And it's kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know? That my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are.  Aww, thank you.  And uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first. And so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano. And wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out alright. And ya know, the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like three months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes, ""Well, that's your first single."" (Laughing)  And I'm like, well.  Well, you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor (Laughing)  That's awesome. There's a part two coming out next month.  Alright, great (Laughing)  Well, congratulations 'cause it's your first single. First top ten hit and thats pretty exciting. And I know you're off to the races here. You're just doing great and, uh, congratulations, very exciting for you!  Awesome, its been so exciting, Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?  Um, I don't know. I don't know. We'll have to look into that. (Laughing)  Well, I'll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it.  Ya do? What would-  Yeah.  What would their name be?  Uh, um, I think Taylor something.  Something like that, yeah  But.  Well, I'll, I'll be more than happy to have you out with me.  Just consider it.  Ah, well that's very good! You're pretty fearless, Taylor Swift. I'll tell ya that.  Right she's, she's gonna be forward this time.  I think so. Country Countdown USA is now a booking agency as well.  Absolutely.  Hey Taylor, I know you're on the road, thank ya so much for joining us.  It was awesome and thank you. It was good to meet you, Tim.  You too. Good talking to you. Bye bye now.  Bye.  Good luck out there.  Thanks!Embed"

586,Taylor Swift,N/A,The Future of Music Is a Love Story,NA,"Before I tell you my thoughts on the matter, you should know that you're reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist: one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dying…it's just coming alive There are many (many) people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity. I am not one of them. In my opinion, the value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace. Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically, and every artist has handled this blow differently In recent years, you've probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away, for this promotion or that exclusive deal. My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet…is that they all realize their worth and ask for it Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for. It's my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is. I hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their art Arrows Through the Heart In mentioning album sales, I'd like to point out that people are still buying albums, but now they're buying just a few of them. They are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone. It isn't as easy today as it was 20 years ago to have a multiplatinum-selling album, and as artists, that should challenge and motivate us There are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in people's lives forever. The way I see it, fans view music the way they view their relationships. Some music is just for fun, a passing fling (the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit, that they will soon forget they ever danced to). Some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives, like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past However, some artists will be like finding ""the one."" We will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren. As an artist, this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans. I think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond, the one my father has with the Beach Boys and the one my mother has with Carly Simon I think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise. No, I did not say ""shock""; I said ""surprise."" I believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other, so why can't this love affair exist between an artist and their fans? In the YouTube generation we live in, I walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online. To continue to show them something they had never seen before, I brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me. My generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored, and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient. We want to be caught off guard, delighted, left in awe. I hope the next generation's artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes, as challenging as that might be There are a few things I have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years, the first being autographs. I haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iPhone with a front-facing camera. The only memento ""kids these days"" want is a selfie. It's part of the new currency, which seems to be ""how many followers you have on Instagram."" Fan Power You might also likeA friend of mine, who is an actress, told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses, the casting director chose the actress with more Twitter followers. I see this becoming a trend in the music industry. For me, this dates back to 2005 when I walked into my first record-label meetings, explaining to them that I had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called Myspace. In the future, artists will get record deals because they have fans—not the other way around Another theme I see fading into the gray is genre distinction. These days, nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence. The wild, unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes. Pop sounds like hip hop; country sounds like rock; rock sounds like soul; and folk sounds like country—and to me, that's incredible progress. I want to make music that reflects all of my influences, and I think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a career-defining path and more of an organizational tool This moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless. In this moment in music, stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded, and sonic evolution is not only accepted…it is celebrated. The only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all Celebrity Spotlight I predict that some things will never change. There will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians, especially the younger ones. Artists who were at their commercial peak in the '70s, '80s and '90s tell me, ""It was never this crazy for us back then!"" And I suspect I'll be saying that same thing to younger artists someday (God help them). There continues to be a bad girl vs. good girl/clean-cut vs. sexy debate, and for as long as those labels exist, I just hope there will be contenders on both sides. Everyone needs someone to relate to And as for me? I'll just be sitting back and growing old, watching all of this happen or not happen, all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism And I'd also like a nice garden5Embed"

608,Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift (Big Machine Radio Release Special),The Outside - Commentary,NA,"Taylor Swift: I wrote the song ""The Outside"" and it was when I was, um, youngers and stuff in middle school. I wasn't accepted, I was kind of an outcast, on the outside looking in, and I wrote that song about it. And I thought it was important to include it on the album because I wasn't always in this position. I didn't always have a lot of people around me, and I think it's important to remember where you came from and remember when you weren't on top of the world. Becca: Like so many of her songs, a lot of people turn to Taylor Swift's ""The Outside"" to help them navegate the waters when it didn't quite feel like they belonged.Embed"
609,Taylor Swift,N/A,The Power of Pop,Elle Magazine,"I'm highly biased, but I think that the way music can transport you back to a long-forgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time. To this day, when I hear ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" by the Dixie Chicks, I instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old, sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in Pennsylvania. I'm clutching a guitar and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time, rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house. When I hear ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"" by Panic! At The Disco, I’m transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of Hendersonville, Tennessee, with my best friend Abigail, euphorically screaming the lyrics. When I hear ""How to Save a Life"" by The Fray, ""Breathe (2AM)"" by Anna Nalick, or ""The Story"" by Brandi Carlile, I immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end. When I'd get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew, I would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room – just being alone with those songs (Those are all from the Grey's Anatomy soundtrack. My commitment to that show truly knows no bounds). I'm convinced that ""You Learn"" by Alanis Morissette, ""Put Your Records On"" by Corinne Bailey Rae and ""Why"" by Annie Lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs.  I love writing songs because I love preserving memories, like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had. I like to use nostalgia as inspiration when I'm writing songs for the same reason I like to take photographs. I like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times. I want to remember the color of the sweater, the temperature of the air, the creak of the floorboards, the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever. The fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of. I thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being, well, universal. You'd think that as pop writers, we're supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to, so you'd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic… AND YET the ones I think cut through the most are actually the most detailed, and I don’t mean in a Shakespearean sonnet type of way, although I love Shakespeare as much as the next girl. Obviously. (See ""Love Story,"" 2009). In modern pop, songs/bops/chunes including extremely personal details like ""Kiki, do you love me"" and ""Baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover"" have been breaking through on the most global cultural level. This year on tour, I got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from Cuba singing about Havana. I think these days, people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to. We like being confided in and hearing someone say, ""this is what I went through"" as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles. We actually do NOT want our pop music to be generic. I think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator, a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive. This glimpse into the artist’s story invites us to connect it to our own, and in the best case scenario, allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories. It's this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal, or made us cry, dance, or escape that truly stands the test of time. Just like a great book.Embed"

And, um, so, it was a really tough time that I wrote that song and helped her through it, and she's fine now, so it's good.

That means there are a lot of milestones to celebrate around this time of year. In fact, it was twelve years ago that wе were first introduced to Taylor through hеr self-titled debut album. You know, when you think about it, it's hard to believe that's already been twelve years and, in sme ways, it's hard to believe it's only been twelve years. But it happened October 24th, 2006, that's when the world was introduced to Taylor Swift and all of her incredible songs, like ""Tim McGraw,"" ""Teardrops On My Guitar,"" ""Picture to Burn,"" and all of those songs that laid the foundation for what has become an incredible carreer for Taylor Swift. And during this special, we're going to revisit every single one of those songs off of Taylor Swift's debut album. We're also gonna be hearing from Taylor, we have dugged back into our archives and found Taylor talking about this album and where she was at in her life back at that time. Not surprising, she says Tim McGraw is a song that she wrote based on one of her true personal life stories, in fact, she didn't actually think that it would be a significant in her carrer as it was. Taylor Swift: I wrote it about this guy that I was dating that was about to go off for college and I knew we were gonna break up, so I started thinking about all the things I knew that reminded him of me. And, um, you know, one of the first things that came to mind was Tim McGraw. And this song, really, I didn't think anything of it when I wrote it. Certainly didn't think it would be a single, certainly didn't think it would be a hit single. And, you know, when I played it to my record label, they were just, like, ""Well, that's your first single."" Becca: For a lot of people, this was their introdution to Taylor Swift. When this song came on the radio, it's ""Tim McGraw"" on Big Machine Radio.Embed"

639,Taylor Swift,N/A,"To Apple, Love Taylor",NA,"I’m sure you are aware that Apple Music will be offering a free 3 month trial to anyone who signs up for the service. I’m not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company. This is not about me. Thankfully I am on my fifth album and can support myself, my band, crew, and entire management team by playing live shows. This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt. This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field…but will not get paid for a quarter of a year’s worth of plays on his or her songs. These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call. I realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers and producers for the 3 month trial period… even if it is free for the fans trying it out. Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done. I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right. But I say to Apple with all due respect, it’s not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don’t ask you for free iPhones. Please don’t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation. TaylorEmbed"

675,Taylor Swift,reputation,Why She Disappeared [Poem],NA,"Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices Echoes she heard even in her sleep: ""Whatever you say, it is not right."" ""Whatever you do, it is not enough."" ""Your kindness is fake."" ""Your pain is manipulative."" When she lay there on the ground, She dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something, Not just the idea of something. When she finally rose, she rose slowly Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies Wary of phone calls and promises, Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck Bathed in her brokenness Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed Standing broad-shouldered next to her was a love that was really something, not just the idea of something. When she turned to go home, She heard the echoes of new words ""May your heart remain breakable But never by the same hand twice"" And even louder: ""without your past, you could never have arrived- so wondrously and brutally, By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance ...here."" And in the death of her reputation, She felt truly alive.30Embed"

712,Taylor Swift,2004 Demo CD (Three Songs),Your Face,NA,I heard a song tonight on the radio Another girl sings about a boy Just sees his face in every space in every room And I know that if I turn around you won't be there If I close my eyes will you be there?  I don't want to lose your face And I don't want to wake one day And not remember what time erased And I don't want to turn around Because I’m not scared Of what love gave me and took away And I don't want to lose your face  I've got a picture of you in my bedroom And I hope it never falls And I hope I never lose that feeling I used to get when you would call And now I wonder to myself Who were you and where are you? Were you ever here at all?  I don't want to lose your face And I don't want to wake one day And not remember what time erased And I don't want to turn around Because I’m not scared Of what love gave me and took away And I don't want to lose your face You might also like That girl in the song had it so good I wish I could close my eyes and see you I wish the sky had your face And the oceans had your eyes And the sunset had your lips And I had you  I don't want to lose your face And I don't want to wake one day And not remember what time erased And I don't want to turn around Because I’m not scared Of what love gave me and took away And I don't want to lose your face1Embed
